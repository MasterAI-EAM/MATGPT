PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 3000\u202frpm followed by baking at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 20\u202fmin in the air. The same process parameters of spin-coating are suitable for DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS. The mixed lead precursor solution was preheated at 90\u202f\u00b0C on a hot plate and spin-coated at 6000\u202frpm onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were preheated and kept at 40\u202f\u00b0C during the whole spin-coating process, which was realized by using the spin-coater with the function of substrate-preheating. And then the MAI precursor solution with different 1,6-DD content (0\u202fwt%, 0.025\u202fwt%, 0.05\u202fwt%, 0.075\u202fwt%, and 0.1\u202fwt%) was dropping-coated, waiting for 30\u202fs after the liquid spreading evenly, and spin-coated at 6000\u202frpm followed annealing at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 40\u202fmin.

Formamidinium iodide (FAI, CH(NH2)2I) and methylammonium bromide (MABr, CH3NH3Br) were acquired from Dyesol.\n\nPCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene to the concentration of 20 mg mL\u22121 and was stirred for 60 min. Triton X-100 was added to the PCBM solution with different weight percentages with respect to PCBM (1, 3, and 5 wt%) and stirred for 60 min. The homogeneously mixed surfactant-modified PCBM (s-PCBM) solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter (pore size: 0.45 \u03bcm) and used as an electron transport material for perovskite solar cells.\n\nThe PSCs were fabricated on patterned, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15 \u03a9 sq\u22121 (Pilkington).

A NiOX hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited by spin-coating a NiOX nanocrystal (NC) dispersion solution at 3000 rpm. NiOX NCs were synthesized according to the procedures reported elsewhere. Briefly, 0.05 mol of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O) was dispersed in 20 mL of DI water. Then 6 mL of NaOH solution (10 mol L\u22121) was slowly dropped into the solution to obtain a large amount of precipitation and stirred for 30 min. The precipitate was washed with deionized water three times, and dried at 80 \u00b0C. The obtained cyan powder was then calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 2 h (ramping rate: 5 \u00b0C min\u22121) to produce a black NiOX powder. The obtained NiOX NCs were dispersed in DI water to 15 mg ml\u22121 concentration.

H. Im. All chemicals were used as received. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized by mixing methylamine (CH3NH2) (27.8 mL, 0.273 mol, 40 wt% in methanol, Alfa Aesar) and hydroiodic acid (HI) (30 mL, 0.227 mol, 57 wt% in water, Alfa Aesar) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask, and stirring the mixture in an ice-water bath for 2 h. The yellowish raw product obtained by evaporating the solvent was recrystallized three times from a mixture of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the solid was collected in a dark container and dried at 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven overnight. Anhydrous EuI2 was synthesized and purified based on the method proposed by Chengpeng D. Anhydrous EuI2 was prepared by dissolving europium oxide (Eu2O3) and ammonium iodide (NH4I) into HI to form a transparent solution. We obtained a dense solid after we evaporated the solution. Then the solid was placed into a quartz tube for vacuum dehydration in a tube heating furnace, until it was completely dehydrated. After that, the dehydrated solid was sintered until the solid turned to transparent melt. Eventually, anhydrous EuI2 in bulk polycrystalline was obtained.\n\nDevices were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy CO., LTD., OPV-FTO22-7). Initially, FTO was etched with 2 mol L\u22121 HCl solution and zinc metal powder. Substrates were then cleaned sequentially by soap solution (2 vol% Hellmanex\u2122 detergent), deionized water, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol (IPA) and UV exposure. Nickel(II) acetylacetonate was dissolved in ethanol (0.1 mol L\u22121) with adding 5.3 \u03bcL ethanolamine (38 wt%) into the solution. The solution was then stirred in a sealed glass vial in air overnight. Then the NiO solution was spin-coated onto the UV\u2013ozone treated FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 60 min in ambient.\nThe perovskite thin film was deposited by using a process similar to that described in a previous work. The MAPbI3:x% EuI2 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I (1 mmol), PbI2 (1.05 mmol; Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) and EuI2 (a corresponding mass fraction of PbI2) in g-butyrolactone (GBL)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3; 1 mL) with a total concentration of 1 M and stirring at 70 \u00b0C overnight. The perovskite thin films spread with 80 \u03bcL was spin coated onto the FTO/NiO substrate followed by a two-stage spin-coating process at 1000 rpm for 15 s and 4000 rpm for 45 s. Then chlorobenzene (600 \u03bcL; Alfa Aesar, 99%) was dripped as anti-solvent after 25 s the second stage to obtain a light-brown smooth film. Afterward, the perovskite film was annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min to convert to a dark-brown film.

UV-vis absorption spectra measurement was carried out on a Hitachi U-3010 spectroscope, and was employed to assess the absorption properties of the doped perovskite sensitized NiO thin film. The morphology of the film was tested with scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-7401F). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured in air with equipment developed by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) combined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDS, EDAX Octane Pro). X-ray energies corresponded to I, Pb and Eu were collected as the SEM scanned the electron beam over the surface and cross-sectional area in FTO substrate. The X-ray data was synchronized with the SEM image and an \u2018element image\u2019 was created showing the presence of the selected element throughout the selected area.\nThe current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were measured with a 2400 Series SourceMeter (Keithley Instruments) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at an equivalent to 100 mW cm\u22122 irradiance generated by an thermo oriel 91192-1000 simulator, with the intensity being calibrated with an VLSI standards incorporated PN 91150V Si reference cell.

The sheet resistance of ITO (170 nm in thickness) was 11 \u03a9 per square.\nMethylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by reacting 16 mL of CH3NH2 solution and 10 mL of HI solution in a 3-necked 100 mL round-bottom flask filled with argon at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h with stirring. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator at 50 \u00b0C. The pale yellow precipitate was recrystallized with ethanol twice, filtered and washed with enough ethyl ether to remove the yellow by-product. The white product was dried at 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 24 h, weighed and stored in an argon-filled glove box before use.\n\nWe used Zn powder and concentrated HCl to pattern the ITO substrates. The part to be remained was covered with tapes during etching. The patterned ITO substrates were first ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, rubbed using cotton, and then rinsed with distilled water.

Data were acquired with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV for the latter. X-ray emissions of Pb M\u03b11 and I L\u03b11 at 2.3455 keV and 3.9376 keV respectively are chosen for analysis. We chose Pb M\u03b11 emission instead of Pb L\u03b11 emission (at 10.5515 keV) because of the stronger peak intensity of the former. The measured atomic ratios of I/Pb were calibrated with that of PbI2, which is 2:1. UV-visible absorption of perovskite films in VSR was recorded with a UV-vis spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi).

The product was washed with diethyl ether three times and finally dried at 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.\nTo prepare the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution (43 wt%), the as-synthesized MAI and commercial PbI2 (ultra-dry, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were dissolved in a mixture of dimethylformammide (DMF, \u226599%; Sigma-Aldrich) and DMSO (DMSO, 99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich) at a DMF:DMSO:PbI2 8.2:1:1 w/w, then stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h. The CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin-coated onto the WO3\u2212x-coated ITO substrate by a single step procedure at a rate of 4000 rpm. for 25 s. Solvent dripping was made with a 250 \u03bcL of toluene 14 s before the end of the spin-coating process. Eventually, the perovskite film was thermally annealed for 10 min at 100 \u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, a PC60BM (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) solution (25 mg mL\u22121 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The device cathode, consisting of a 0.5 nm-thick LiF layer and a 150 nm-thick Al layer, was thermally evaporated atop the device at a pressure of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar.\n\nXRD patterns were recorded with a D8-Discover Bruker diffractometer (3.3 kW) equipped with a Cu source (operated at 40/40 mA/kV), a Goebel mirror, an Eurelian cradle goniometer, and a scintillator detector. The samples for measurements were prepared by depositing CNRs from a concentrated colloidal solution onto silicon substrates, and then allowing the solvent to evaporate. XRD patterns were collected, in 2\u03b8 scan mode with a fixed incident angle of 5\u00b0, moving the detector over the 2\u03b8 range 10\u00b0\u2013120\u00b0 with a step size of 0.05\u00b0.\n\nConventional TEM investigation was performed on the as-synthesized WO3\u2212x CNRs with a JEOL JEM 1400Plus microscope, equipped with a GATAN Orius SC600 CCD camera and a W filament-source operating at 120 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by drop-casting a few drops of suitably dilute CNR solutions onto standard carbon-coated copper TEM grids in a N2-protected glove-box and allowing the solvent to evaporate. The as-prepared sample grids were then transferred into the TEM microscope.\n\nAFM characterization was obtained with a park scanning probe microscope (PSIA) operating in air and in a noncontact mode to reduce tip induced surface degradation.

Solvent contact angles were measured on WO3\u2212x samples treated in the same way as the WO3\u2212x films destined for devices. The presented results correspond to an average of measurements performed onto many areas of three samples.\n\nThe devices were characterized using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit and a calibrated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Newport 91160A) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122. The solar simulator irradiance was set to 100 mW cm\u22122 using a thermopile radiant power meter with a fused-silica window (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 70260). The active area of the complete device was 0.04 cm\u22122. All devices are tested using 100 mV s\u22121 or 1000 mV s\u22121 scan rates, under a nitrogen atmosphere at 22 \u00b0C. A calibrated filtered Si diode (Newport, 91150V) served as the reference cell for J\u2013V measurements.\n\nSteady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence were measured by an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (185\u2013850 nm). An Edinburgh Xe900 450 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the exciting light source. Corrected spectra were obtained via a calibration curve supplied with the instrument. Emission lifetimes were determined with the single photon counting technique by means of the same Edinburgh FLS980 spectrometer using a laser diode as the excitation source (1 MHz, \u03bbexc = 635 nm, 57 ps pulse width and about 30 ps time resolution after deconvolution with an excitation power of 0.52 mW cm\u22122) and a Hamamatsu MCP R3809U-50 (time resolution 20 ps) as detector. Perovskite thin films sealed with a 50 nm-thick poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) layer were excited at 635 nm with a 250 W Tungsten continuous-wave light source, resulting in an effective excitation power of 1.6 mW cm\u22122.\n\nMacroscopic KP measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a 2 mm diameter gold tip amplifier (Ambient Kelvin Probe Package from KP Technology Ltd). The KP technique provided a voltage resolution of about 5 mV on a sampled surface area of about 3 mm2.

Finally, a white-colored powder was collected and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h under vacuum. The mixture of PbCl2:CH3NH3I with a 1:3 molar ratio was dissolved in DMF and then stirred at 60 \u00b0C overnight, giving the perovskite precursor solution.\n\nThe used device structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). ITO-coated glass substrates (15 \u03a9 sq\u22121) were ultrasonically-coated in acetone and ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, then UV-Ozone cleaner for 15 min. A film (45 nm thick) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4500 rpm and annealed at 140 \u00b0C for 10 min. Then, the prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm.

For the EEF assisted annealing process, EEFs were exerted on the perovskite films using a conductive glass cover, where a spacing of about 60\u201380 \u03bcm was set [Fig. S1(a)\u2020]. To acquire the spacing, we put a plastic strip between two of the same conductive substrates to build a similar flat capacitor with air as the dielectric. Using C = \u03b5A/d, the spacing can be deduced by measuring the capacitance. The electric field intensity (E) can be obtained based on E = V/d, where V is the applied DC voltage (60 V or 150 V). During the cooling process from 100 \u00b0C to room temperature, the EEF was kept constant, and the photo taken during the EEF assisted annealing treatment is shown in Fig. S1(b).\u2020 A PCBM layer was deposited from a 20 mg mL\u22121 chlorobenzene solution at 2000 rpm.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott\u2013Schottky capacitance analysis were surveyed by Ivium (Netherlands). The absorption spectra were measured with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The surface morphology and element distribution in energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using PANalytica 80 equipment (Empyrean, Cu K\u03b1 radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm). 2D-GIXRD patterns were obtained by a MarCCD 225 detector mounted vertically at a distance of around 256.401 mm from the sample with an exposure time of 100 s at a grazing incidence angle of 0.2\u00b0.

P\u2013E loops were tested by PMF0312-295 (Radiant Technologies, USA). The dielectric spectra were tested by a Precision Impedance Analyzer (Agilent 4294A).\nKelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is tested by PMF0312-295 (Radiant Technologies, USA), which is based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S7(g) in the ESI\u2020). Firstly, the surface topography is mapped in the tapping mode. Secondly, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the AFM tip and the sample is detected by retracing at a left height from the sample surface. During the second test procedure, a compensated DC voltage is applied to offset the potential difference between the tip and sample. Therefore, local potential distribution on the sample surface is observed, and the work function of the sample is obtained if the tip\u2019s work function is known.

The indium and tin oxide target (ITO target, Plasmaterial 99.99%) films were RF magnetron sputtered using a Moorfield Nanolab 60 sputtering system at 0.37 W cm\u22122 and 2.06 W cm\u22122 for the bottom and top layers.\n\nPilkington TEC15 TM (<15 \u03a9 cm\u22122) glass was first gently scrubbed with a concentrated solution of Hellmanex\u00ae III (10% by volume) diluted in de-ionised water and rinsed with copious amounts of de-ionised water. Substrates were then submerged and sonicated in a 2% by volume Hellmanex solution diluted in de-ionised water (\u223c18 m\u03a9) at 80 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. After this time, the substrates were removed and rinsed with more de-ionised water and placed into a bath of de-ionised water (only) and sonicated for a further 20 minutes at 80 \u00b0C to remove any residual surfactant. After this the substrates were subsequently rinsed with copious amounts of de-ionised water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. The substrates were then blown dry with a nitrogen air knife and placed into an oxygen plasma cleaner for 15 minutes on full power to remove any residual carbon contaminants and make the surfaces more hydrophilic. Lastly samples were placed in UV\u2013ozone chamber for 15 minutes to aid with improved wettability and film formation for the subsequent SnO2 layer. Substrate preparation was carried out in a validated class 1000 clean room.\nSnO2 ETL layers were prepared by diluting (44592) Tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion procured from Alfa Aesar further in de-ionised water to the ratio 1:2.6 mL to give a final solution of 4.2 wt%. These were then deposited via spin coating immediately after UV\u2013ozone treatment of the FTO was finished. We note that the increased wetting effects of UV\u2013ozone on FTO films lasts no longer than 10 minutes, we found it imperative that films were spin coated before this time limit elapsed. 150 \u03bcL of the final ETL solution was spin coated onto a 28 mm by 28 mm glass/FTO substrate at 2000 rpm/2000 rpm s\u22121 for 30 s, we noted improved surface coverage by depositing the solution dynamically at 25 s. The substrates were then placed on a hotplate at 110 \u00b0C for 10 minutes then a 5 minute ramp to 180 \u00b0C for 1 hour to anneal the final films. We note that processing conditions in the laboratory are critical to good film formation, noting that a very dry room (<25% RH) coupled with a nitrogen flowed Laurel (Model: WS-650 Mz-23NPPB spin processor) spin coater contributed to rapid drying of the film, resulting in detrimental pin hole defects. Increased humidity of >30% RH and no nitrogen flowing in the spin coater resulted in more homogenous films. These conditions should be considered when trying to fabricate such a layer as the effects can be easily negated although are not obvious during manufacture procedure was carried out in nitrogen filled glove-box.\nMAPI perovskite was prepared by dissolving 605 mg of lead iodide (PbI2) procured from TCI America and 199 mg of methylammonium iodide (MAI) procured from GreatCellSolar in 1 mL of 4:1 ratio of dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide. We noted that by dissolving the inorganic PbI2 at elevated temperatures >150 \u00b0C resulted in better perovskite film formation with fewer pinholes as report in literature. The solution was then filtered using a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE filter and deposited on top of the SnO2via solution processed spin coating (125 \u03bcL, 4000 rpm/2000 rpm s\u22121 for 30 s). During the spin coating process, 200 \u03bcL of ethyl acetate procured from Sigma Aldrich was deposited dynamically onto the spinning substrate 22 s before the end the second spin programme. Once the spin coating procedure had finished the films were transferred to a hotplate and annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The entire perovskite procedure was carried out in nitrogen filled glove-box.\nFor the hole transporting material (HTM), a spiro-OMeTAD solution (100 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 36 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), 20 \u03bcL of a lithium-bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (516 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 8 \u03bcL of a FK209 (300 mg in 1 mL of acetonitrile) in 996 \u03bcL of chlorobenzene) was spin-coated dynamically at 4000 rpm, 4000 rpm s\u22121 for 12 s on top of the annealed perovskite. Again, the preparation and deposition of the HTM was performed in a nitrogen filled glove-box.

The transmittance of the IAI films were scanned suing a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrometer. The sheet resistance of the IAI films were measured using a Jandel RM3000 four-point probe station. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a D8 Discover (Bruker) X-ray diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scans were collected between 10 and 60 degree with a 0.02 degree step.\nFor current\u2013voltage measurements of solar cell devices were masked to 0.09 cm2 and tested under a class AAA solar simulator (Newport Oriel Sol3A) at AM 1.5 and 100 mW cm\u22122 illumination conditions calibrated against a KG5 filtered silicon reference cell (Newport Oriel 91150-KG5) using a Keithley 2400 source meter.

For stabilized power output measurements, device bias was set to the maximum power point voltage determined by the J\u2013V sweep and current monitored under 1000 W m\u22122 illumination.\nStability measurements were performed on unencapsulated devices kept at open circuit in a light soaking unit (Solaronix Solixon A20), at 25 \u00b0C and ambient humidity, under 1 sun illumination: both reverse and forward scans, at 15 mV s\u22121 scan rate, were carried at every hour.

MAI was prepared in-house. In a typical procedure, 24 ml of a 33 wt% methylamine (CH3NH2) solution in anhydrous ethanol was reacted with 10 ml of 57 wt% hydroiodic acid (HI) in water, in 100 ml of ethanol (excess CH3NH2) in a dry Ar atmosphere at room temperature. The solvent and excess CH3NH2 were removed using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting MAI powder was harvested.\n\nFirst, a 0.8 M PbI2 (Alfa-Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) solution in N,N\u2032-dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated onto different substrates: plain glass, quartz, previously patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (TEC15, Hartford Glass Co., Hartford City, IN), or the patterned FTO-coated glass with a TiO2 blocking layer (\u223c15 nm). A smooth, nanoporous PbI2 thin film was formed, which was then dried at room temperature under blowing air. Second, a fresh MAI solution of 10 mg ml\u22121 in anhydrous isopropanol was spin-coated onto the as-prepared PbI2 layer immediately, and was then annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 1 min, which constitutes the first SSCA cycle. This SSCA cycle was then repeated 3 to 4 times. The excess MAI was washed with isopropanol, and the final thin films were annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 2 min to obtain a dark-colored perovskite film. The film thickness can be controlled by the spinning conditions. The spin-coating conditions of 4000 rpm for 15 s was used for all thin film depositions, which resulted in 250\u2013300 nm MAPbI3 perovskite thin films. The nature of the substrate (plain glass, quartz, FTO-coated glass, and FTO-coated glass with a TiO2 blocking layer) did not have any obvious effects on the SSCA-processed MAPbI3 perovskite films.\n\nFor the fabrication of the PSCs, the FTO-coated glass was patterned by 25% hydrochloric acid etching with zinc powder, and cleaned by soaking in a base bath (5 wt% NaOH in ethanol) overnight. After washing with deionized water and ethanol, a compact TiO2 blocking layer was deposited on top of the patterned FTO by spray pyrolysis at 450 \u00b0C. The perovskite layer was then deposited using the SSCA process (one, two or three SSCA cycles), as described above. This was followed by spin-coating a solution of a HTM, which consisted of 80 mg 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD; Merck, Germany), 30 \u03bcl bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt stock solution (500 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 30 \u03bcl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 1 ml chlorobenzene solvent. The HTM spin-coating process was performed in a dry-air atmosphere with less than 10% humidity. Finally a 150 nm Ag layer was deposited using a thermal evaporator and a shadow mask. The PSCs were stored in a dry-air atmosphere with a humidity below 5%, and the performance of the PSC was typically measured one day after their fabrication.\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a X-ray diffractometer (D8-Advance, Bruker, Germany) using Cu K\u03b11 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at step size/time of 0.02\u00b0/1 s. The surface morphology of the films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; LEO 1530VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The local roughness of the MAPbI3 thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; 5500, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) operated in contact mode. Optical spectroscopy (transmission, refection, absorption) of the films on quartz at each formation stage was conducted on a spectral response measurement system (QEXL, PV Measurements, Boulder, CO). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize cross-sections of the whole PSCs. Note that this particular PSC has a thinner HTM layer compared to most of the other PSCs fabricated in this study. The samples from specific locations on the cross-sections were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB; Helios 600, FEI, Hillisboro, OR) and in situ lift-out. The TEM specimens were examined by TEM (2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at a 200 kV accelerating voltage.\n\nThe incident external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs were recorded at a chopping frequency of 5 Hz in AC mode on a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurements, Boulder, CO). The current density (J)\u2013voltage (V) characteristics of the PSCs were obtained using a 2400 SourceMeter (Keithley, Cleveland, OH) under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm\u22122) (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA). A typical J\u2013V scan starts from a forward-bias to a short-circuit at a rate of 20 mV s\u22121. A typical active area of 0.12 cm2 was defined using a non-reflective mask for the J\u2013V measurements. The steady-state maximum power output of the solar cells was measured by monitoring the current density (J) output at the maximum power voltage (V) bias for up to 300 s using a VersaSTAT MC potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Acton, MA). The current output can be converted to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) output using the following equation: PCE = (J (mA cm\u22122) \u00d7 V (V))/(100 (mW cm\u22122)). A shutter was used to switch on and off the one-sun illumination on the cell. Solar-cell testing was conducted in the ambient atmosphere with a humidity of 20\u201340%. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) on the PSCs was performed using a PARSTAT 2273 workstation (Princeton Applied Research, Acton, MA) with the frequency range of 0.1 Hz\u2013100 kHz and the modulation amplitude of 10 mV. The IS spectra were analyzed using ZView 2.9c software (Scribner Associates, Southern Pines, NC).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: ,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 150 >> 150,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 1.0 >> 2.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.12,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The solar cells have been prepared following a recently described method. In brief MAPbI3 was prepared by a two-step spin coating procedure. The PbI2 layer was first deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 film deposited fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass, which was followed by coating the MAI solution. The MAPbI3 layer was finally annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 5 min. Spiro-MeOTAD was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 layer and Au was finally deposited on the spiro-MeOTAD. Incomplete cells with three different MAI concentrations (0.032 M, 0.044 M and 0.063 M) without HTL and Au electrode were also analysed. The preparation procedures were kept identical to the complete devices.\n\nThe solar simulator used is equipped with a 1000 W xenon short arc lamp and a Keithley 2651A source meter. The light intensity was calibrated through a Si reference cell in order to give a 1 sun light intensity according to the AM 1.5 G spectrum (class A, AM 1.5 G deviation <2%). No spectral mismatch correction was applied. For efficiency measurements, the cells were equipped with a non-reflective black mask which defined a 0.16 cm2 active area (out of the total active area size of \u223c0.5 cm2). The scan direction was from the starting voltage of 1.2 V towards the final point at \u22120.1 V with a 20 mV voltage step and 200 ms time interval between each step. For each typology 3\u20135 cells were measured giving average conversion efficiency and standard deviation of 7.87 \u00b1 1.31%, 17.07 \u00b1 0.31%, 12.03 \u00b1 0.58% for 0.032 M, 0.044 M and 0.063 M, respectively. The largest standard deviation for 0.032 M devices is also representative for the stronger non-uniformity of the perovskite layer. Out of the 3\u20135 samples for every cell typology, one device was chosen for the complete characterization (I\u2013V sun, I\u2013V dark, VOCvs. light intensity, EL- and PL-imaging and \u03bc-LBIC) and the corresponding results shown.\n\nThe investigation of surface and cross sections of the TiO2/perovskite films was carried out through a Schottky emission scanning electron microscope SEM (Hitachi, SU-70).\n\nThe experimental PL setup consists of a cooled 1 MP Silicon CCD camera, a spatially homogeneous excitation light in the whole active area of the cell (\u223c0.5 cm2) with about 1.2 Sun light intensity obtained by a 2 halogen-lamp-system filtered by a 650 nm dielectric short-pass filter and an absorption band-pass filter with a transmittance of 500\u2013900 nm. A power source and a stack of optical filters between the camera and the sample completed the equipment. The filter stack of the camera lens was composed of a 725 nm dielectric long-pass and an absorption long-pass with a smooth edge from 720 nm to 760 nm in order to obtain a sufficient suppression of excitation light incident on the camera. Furthermore a short pass filter is put in front of the camera filter stack to suppress light above 900 nm. The operating point of the cell was changed through the power source from VOC to 0 V. PL images were acquired with 50\u2013100 mV voltage steps (smaller voltage steps close to VOC were used to better follow the steep I\u2013V curve behaviour in this range). For every step an equilibration time of 2 s was used. Integration time was in the range 0.1\u20130.5 s per image. The spatial resolution was about 40 \u03bcm per camera pixel. The EL setup shared the same equipment. EL measurements were performed in the dark by application of a forward bias voltage. The filter stack was removed since no filtering of excitation light was necessary. The operating point of the cell was changed from 800 mV to 1300 mV with 50 mV voltage steps while EL images were acquired. Integration time was changed as a function of the operating point from 60 s to 0.5 s in order to get a high signal-to-noise ratio. It was observed that the prolonged application of high voltages during EL measurements reversibly modified the electrical characteristics of the cell. In particular, the current at a fixed high voltage was seen to decrease. A similar behaviour was also observed on the PL intensity (decrease) with light exposure. Following equilibrium conditions, the original parameters were restored within tens of seconds. A short integration time was used for PL and EL in order to minimize the device perturbation. Moreover, a recovery time of 60 s was taken between every step to avoid overheating of the device (in case of PL) and permit a complete device re-equilibration.\n\n\u03bc-PL and \u03bc-LBIC (Light Beam Induced Current) allow the investigation of photoluminescence and current generation with a micrometric resolution on the device. The cell is mounted on a movable stage. Excitation is done via a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm, which is focused on the sample. For the large area \u03bc-LBIC maps, an objective lens with an NA = 0.26 is used to obtain a low depth of focus. The intensity is set to 1 sun equivalent photon flux of about 7 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 s\u22121 and spot size to 20 \u03bcm in diameter. The induced current is measured by a highly sensitive current preamplifier. Emitted PL is collected with the same lens as is used for excitation, directed towards a grating spectrometer and detected by a silicon line CCD. By so doing the PL spectrum can be detected in the illuminated spot. By raster scanning the sample, the spatial resolution is established which is diffraction limited. For the highly resolved \u03bc-PL maps an objective lens with numerical aperture of NA = 0.9 is used, which allows for a diffraction limited spot size of 260 nm and a corresponding spatial resolution. Typical integration times are 10 ms\u2013100 ms per pixel. In complete devices the laser beam was shone from the glass side, meaning that the light passes through the TCO glass till the Au back electrode of the cell. In the case of properties\u2019 investigation of perovskite crystals, incomplete cells were used (TCO/compact_TiO2/mesoporous_TiO2/perovskite). The high resolution \u03bc-PL images were carried out with laser excitation from the perovskite crystal side (capping layer side). 3\u20135 cells for each typology were tested for generating enough statistical data for a robust investigation of \u03bc-PL/\u03bc-LBIC. The resulting differences among samples of similar typology were very small compared to the differences between devices with different MAI concentrations. The cells were stored under dark and in a humidity-free environment throughout the PL\u2013EL measurement timespan to prevent degradation effects.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: ,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown >> 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown >> 5.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.16,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "For the perovskite layer, the MAPbI3 solution was composed of methylammonium lead trihalide (CH3NH3I) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2) in a ratio of 1.06:1 mol%, and it was mixed in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and DMSO (7:3 v/v%) with a molar concentration of 1.4 mol L\u22121 at 100 \u00b0C for 4 h.

The MASnxPb(1\u2212x)I3 thin films on the surface of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) substrate were formed by spin-coating the precursor solution at 6300 rpm, and after 5\u201313 s of delay time the rotated wet films were washed with sec-butyl alcohol (99%, Aladdin) to promote fast nucleation and crystal growth. After the rotation stopped, the films were transferred onto a hot plate for annealing at 100 \u00b0C for 25 s, followed by soaking in sec-butyl alcohol for 8\u201310 s to remove excess MAI. Subsequently, the films were dried by spinning the substrates at 6300 rpm for 35 s. Finally, the films were thermally annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 35 min under a N2 atmosphere and subsequently solvent annealed in a DMF atmosphere at 100 \u00b0C for 35 min to assist the growth of crystalline domains. The film processes were conducted in a nitrogen-purged glove box with oxygen and moisture levels below 0.1 ppm. A schematic illustration of the fabrication steps of MASnxPb(1\u2212x)I3 perovskite films is described in Fig. S1 in the ESI.\u2020\n\nPerovskite solar cells have the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MASnxPb(1\u2212x)I3/PC60BM/Al.

[6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Nano-C. Colloidal suspension of ZnO nanoparticles (Avantama N-10) was obtained from Avantama. All materials are commercially available and were used as received without further purification.\n\nThe p-i-n perovskite solar cells were fabricated with different combinations of ITO/hole transport layer (HTL): ITO/CuI, ITO/CuI/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuI. The device structure was ITO/HTL/perovskite/PCBM/ZnO NP/Ag. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 10 min each. N2 was blown to the glass/ITO substrates to complete the cleaning by removing IPA residues. Then oxygen plasma treatment was applied for 10 min. CuI solutions in acetonitrile with a concentration of 3 mg ml\u22121 were prepared and stirred at room temperature for 3 h in a nitrogen filled glove box. CuI solutions were spin-coated on the cleaned ITO/glass substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min. For some devices, CuI was spin-coated on top of PEDOT:PSS, or PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the CuI layer prior to the deposition of perovskites. As the surface of the CuI layer is hydrophobic, when PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of CuI, a small amount of Dynol 604 (surfactant) was added to the PEDOT:PSS solutions to ensure good film coverage, and then the resulting solution was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm PES filter. The filtered solutions were then spin-coated on the CuI-coated substrate at 3000 rpm for 1 min. All the following steps were performed in a glove box filled with nitrogen. PbI2 and MAI were dissolved (1.193 M for each) in a molar ratio of 1:1 in anhydrous DMF and the resultant mixture was stirred overnight at 70 \u00b0C to produce the perovskite precursor solution. For the FAPbI3 precursor solution, FAI and PbI2 were dissolved (1 M for each) in a molar ratio of 1:1 in a mixed solvent with DMF and DMSO in a volume ratio of 4:1. The solutions were filtered with a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE filter before spin coating. The filtered perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 55s on ITO/HTL substrates. During spin coating, 50 \u03bcl anhydrous CB was dripped onto the substrate at 4\u20135 s after spin coating started. After drying the perovskite films, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C for 20 min, respectively. Twenty milligrams of PCBM was dissolved in 1 ml anhydrous CB. To prepare the solution blends of PCBM and MAI, MAI was dissolved in anhydrous IPA at a concentration of 10 mg ml\u22121. Then a small volume of the MAI solution was added into the PCBM solutions. Either PCBM solutions or PCBM:MAI solution blends were spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 1 min on top of the perovskite layer. Then, ZnO nanoparticles were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s. To complete device fabrication, Ag was thermally evaporated with a thickness of 100 nm in a vacuum chamber (\u223c1 \u00d7 10\u22126Torr).

A standard silicon reference cell was used to calibrate the light intensity. Scans of J\u2013V characteristics were performed with a forward (from short circuit to open circuit) and a reverse (from open circuit to short circuit) direction. The scan rate was 113 mV s\u22121, unless indicated otherwise. To investigate the scan rate dependence, two different scan rates of 22.6 and 1130 mV s\u22121 were considered. To age the devices, they were kept in the dark in the glove box before J\u2013V characteristics measurements. The top view image of the CuI films prepared on ITO and PEDOT:PSS, and the cross-sectional image of the ITO/CuI/perovskite were acquired by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-7610F, JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

An approximately 30 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer was sprayed on the hot FTO substrate using a 0.2 M titanium diisopropoxide-bis(acetylacetonate) solution and sintered at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min. Afterward, according to our previous work, a mesoporous Na-treated TiO2 film was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was deposited via an anti-solvent method. Here, a 50 \u03bcL perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 5 s and then at 4000 rpm for 60 s. During the second step, 120 \u03bcL of chlorobenzene was dropped at the last 5th second. The substrates were then annealed at 120 \u00b0C for 45 min. After cooling, the alternative hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited. According to a previous work, a Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 \u03bcL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 \u03bcL LiN(CF3SO2)2 (LITSFI) solutions (520 mg LiTSFI in 1 ml acetonitrile) were added.

The evaporation rate was 0.9 \u00c5 s\u22121 and the Z-factor of MnS was 0.94. Finally, 80 nm gold was evaporated as the back electrode to form the entire device.\n\nThe crystal structures of MnS and perovskite films were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-7000s, Shimadzu).

Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned successively with deionized water, acetone, and UVO cleaner (Jelight 42). HTL was either PEDOT:PSS or c-OTPD plus TPACA. PEDOT:PSS was spincoated onto ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 50 s and dried in air at 135 \u00b0C for 20 min.

Hole mobilities were calculated using the Mott\u2013Gurney law by fitting eqn (1), where J is the current density, \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 \u00d7 10\u221212 F m\u22121), \u03b5 is the relative permittivity of the material (approaching 3 for organic semiconductors), \u03bc is the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage, and d is the thickness of the active layer, respectively.\n\nPSCs were fabricated with the following structure: FTO/SnO2/PCBM/perovskite/PTZ-TPA/Au on patterned FTO glass. The FTO glass (with a sheet resistance of 20 \u03a9 \u25a1\u22121, PV Tech, China) substrates were pre-cleaned using an ultrasonic bath of chlorobenzene and acetone followed by a treatment in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Novascan Company, USA) for 15 min. The SnO2 electron transport layer was applied following a previously reported procedure. SnCl2\u00b72H2O in ethanol was used as a precursor solution (0.1 M). The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s and then the films were annealed under an ambient atmosphere at 180 \u00b0C for 1 h. A thin layer of PCBM (10 nm) was prepared on the FTO/SnO2 surface at a speed of 2000 rpm and annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCBM solutions were prepared by dissolving 15 mg PCBM in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layer (\u223c320 nm) was then fabricated on the SnO2 film. The film was annealed at 90 \u00b0C for 15 min. The hole-transporting materials PTZ-TPA (41 nm) were deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s from a chlorobenzene solution. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using an Ambios Technology (USA) XP-2 profilometer. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au film was deposited by thermal evaporation (Mbraun MB200) as the cathode. The active area (0.11 cm2) of the devices was determined by the overlap of FTO and the gold electrode. The current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the devices were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley (Zolix ss150 Solar Simulator) 236 source meter. The light source was a xenon lamp coupled with an AM1.5 solar spectrum filter; the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm\u22122. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a solar cell quantum efficiency/external quantum efficiency measurement system (Zolix Solar cell scan 100) model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: SnO2-c | PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 90,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 15,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PTZ-TPA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.11,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "An aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (1.6 wt%, from H.C.

The band gaps and Urbach energies of the perovskite films were obtained from their UV/Vis absorption spectra, which were recorded with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 10 kV. Samples for the SEM study were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape and then coated with a thin layer of platinum film to avoid charging. The thickness of the films was measured from the cross-section SEM images. Nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were conducted using the time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique (UniRAM, Protrustech) along with the instrument response function of a 150 ps pulse duration and repetition rate of 20 MHz. The excitation wavelength was 405 nm. To prevent laser-induced thermal effects, the diameter of the spot size on the sample was increased to 50 \u03bcm, and the excitation power was reduced to 0.1 mW. The spectra were taken with the perovskite film deposited on glass to eliminate the effects from the PEDOT:PSS hole transporter.\n\nThe MAPbI3 precursor solution (1.0 M) was prepared by adding equal moles of MAI and PbI2 to the anhydrous \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL)/dimethylsulfoxide mixture (DMSO) mixed solvent (volume ratio: 1:1). The MA1\u2212xFAxPbI3 precursor solutions were made by replacing various amounts (0.1 mole, 0.2 mole, 0.3 mole and 0.4 mole, respectively) of MAI with FAI in the 1.0 M precursor solution.

The solvents and ligands were changed from those used in conventional synthesis. ODE and OLA were replaced by toluene and benzene ether (BE) when the effect of other ligands such as DPPA was studied. Since DPPA is solid, the use of specific solvents capable of dissolving DPPA and the precursors is required. Nevertheless, the same protocol as that for the conventional approach was followed.\n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was done using a Nicolet 1550 FT-IR spectrometer with a diamond crystal. UV-vis spectroscopy was done using a Cary 50, and the photoluminescence was studied on a Cary Eclipse with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm.

Then, the two as-cast precursor films were placed together face to face, and then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, meanwhile preheat balance weight for applied pressure was put on the top substrate. To apply different pressures, we simply used different balances with different weights on the top substrate. After growth completes, the substrates with perovskite films were physically separated for further use. For comparison, the as-cast precursor film was directly placed on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, which afforded the reference film.

The substrates with the aluminum grid were then exposed to a UV-ozone plasma (MBraun, MB UV-O3) for 15 min to grow the oxide layer. Each of the substrates were coated with a 30 \u00b1 5 nm PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s before being dried on a hot plate at 170 \u00b0C for 10 min.

For the large area devices (25 cm2) the JV curves were measured using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor analyzer with a 4-wire configuration to eliminate the effect of the cable resistances and SMU internal impedance in the measurement circuit. The reason for this is that for the large area devices the current flowing in the circuit was much higher than for the small area devices resulting in a larger voltage drop over the cable resistance and SMU impedance, and thus the four-wire configuration compensates for the voltage drop. For the 0.2 cm2 devices 10 samples and for the 25 cm2 devices three samples were fabricated and tested. EQEs were measured with a QEX7 setup from PV Measurements Inc., using a calibrated photodiode. The area of the focused beam was approximately 0.15 cm2.

The film was preheated at 100 \u00b0C for 3 min before dipping into a FAI 2-propanol solution (15 mg mL\u22121) for 20 s followed by annealing at 145 \u00b0C for 15 min to obtain the desired crystallite formation.\nAs a hole-transporting material (HTM), a Spiro solution (80 mg of Spiro, 10.5 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 46.5 \u03bcL of a lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (170 mg Li-TFSI/1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and a P3HT solution (15 mg mL\u22121 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 on the HC(NH2)2PbI3. The substrates with HTMs were left overnight in dry air in the dark at room temperature. Finally, 80 nm thick Ag was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask defining an active area of 0.04 cm2 on the top of the HTL to produce a complete PeSC device.\n\nThe current\u2013voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM 1.5G filter at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122 illumination, as determined using a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). EQE spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial EQE setup (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD), which was equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, filter wheel, and monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated against a certified silicon reference diode.\nFor the transient photocurrent measurements, the devices were illuminated from the ITO side by a 10 ns pulse width laser flash (Continuum Minilite TM Nd:YAG, 10 Hz repetition rate) at 532 nm. The light intensity on the sample varies under a series of optical density filters. The devices were connected to the 50 \u03a9 input terminal of an oscilloscope.\nThe CELIV set up consists of a pulsed laser (Continuum Minilite TM Nd:YAG), a synthesized function generator (Stanford Research System DS345), a digital delay generator (Stanford Research System DG645), and an oscilloscope (Tektronix MSO 4054) for signal observation and recording. Photo-CELIV measurements are carried out under ambient conditions, and samples are irradiated through the ITO side by a 10 ns, 532 nm laser flash. The linearly increasing voltage with an offset voltage (Uoffset) of 0.4 V and a maximum voltage (Umax) of 3.6 V (P3HT PeSC), and Uoffset = 0.6 V and Umax = 3.4 V (Spiro PeSC) is applied to the device, while the Ag electrode is grounded. The chosen Uoffset exactly compensates for the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices, thereby nulling the internal electric field before the charge carrier extraction.\n\nThe thicknesses of ITO, ZnO, FAPbI3, P3HT, Spiro and Ag layers were estimated using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer.\nThe reflectance and transmittance spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer between 300 and 900 nm with a 1 nm increment.\nEllipsometry measurements were carried out with a Horiba Jobin Yvon UVISEL 2 ellipsometer at incident angles of 70\u00b0 for photon energies between 0.6 and 6 eV with a 30 meV increment. The ZnO, Spiro and P3HT films were prepared following the aforementioned processes except for using clean Si wafers as the substrate. It should be noted that the FAPbI3 films were prepared on the substrate of Si/ZnO, in order to keep the FAPbI3 films same as that in the devices. Modelling of the data was performed using Deltapsi2 software by HORIBA Scientific Company. Before the films were measured, the bare silicon oxide layer was measured, and a thickness of 2 nm was obtained. All measurements were done at room temperature (\u223c298 K).\nSteady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) spectra were obtained on a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-375). A Hamamatsu C5680-04 streak camera was used for TPL.

The active areas of the solar cells were regulated by a shadowing black mask with 0.3\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.3\u202fcm opening.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60 | BCP,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 60; 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10.0; 10.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.09,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}]
