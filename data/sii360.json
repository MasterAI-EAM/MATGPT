A total of 25 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was instilled into a mixture of 1.0 g of graphite and 0.6 g of NaNO3 (sodium nitrate) at room temperature. Then, 3.7 g of KMnO4 (potassium permanganate) was added slowly to keep the reaction temperature below 5 \u00b0C. Sulfuric acid was inserted into the graphite layers at this stage. The reaction temperature of the mixture was kept at 35 \u00b0C with stirring for 2 h and then was increased to 60 \u00b0C for heating for 6 h. Then, 45 mL of water was slowly poured into the solution under vigorous stirring, and a dark brown suspension was produced. The suspension was treated further by adding a mixture of aqueous hydrogen peroxide (3.5 mL, 34.5%) and water (22.5 mL) to convert the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide into soluble manganese sulfate. Graphene oxides were separated from the reaction mixture by ultrasonication. The graphene oxide powder was washed 3 times with diluted hydrochloric acid (1.0 mol L\u22121, 25 mL). Ultrasonic treatment was carried out for 10 minutes before washing. The obtained product was dried for 24 h under vacuum and placed in a dryer with low humidity. The prepared GO was ground and dissolved in absolute ethyl alcohol with PEG. The concentrations of GO and PEG were 10 mg mL\u22121 and 1 mg mL\u22121, respectively. The fabricated solution was ultrasonically treated and stirred to be completely dissolved.\n\nPerovskite films deposited on different substrates such as PEDOT:PSS or its surface modified with GO:PEG were examined with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4700).

In particular, AuAg-alloyed nanoprisms (AuAg-NPrisms in short) are utilized due to their higher stability than the pure Ag nanoprisms (Ag-NPrisms) [], and improved performances have already been demonstrated in organic solar cells with AuAg-NPrisms [,]. Here, the AuAg-NPrisms were prepared using a two-step synthesis method []. First, Ag-NPrisms were synthesized by the seed-mediated approach. Then, the galvanic replacement approach is adopted to turn Ag-NPrisms into AuAg-NPrisms. At last, the AuAg-NPrisms were coated with a thin SiO2 shell (represented by AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2) to prevent exciton quenching using the method of hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). This product was used as the interfacial layer for making highly crystalline quasi-2D PEA based perovskite film. In the solar cell device, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer is pre-coated ahead the perovskite film. In order to spin-coat the AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer without dissolving the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer, it is necessary to change the solution to ethanol by twice centrifugation (7000\u202frpm, 20\u202fmin).\nThe proposed PSCs with an metallic interfacial layer has an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AuAg-NPrism@SiO2/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM/PFN/Ag as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Here, PEA based perovskite crystals with a chemical formula of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (here, n\u202f=\u202f3) is applied as the active layer for absorbing light and generating excitons. The exciton dissociation takes place in the bulk perovskite layer and at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite and perovskite/PC61BM interfaces as well. For the cathode buffer layer, besides of PC61BM, an additional poly[(9,9-bis (3\u2019-(N, N-dimenthylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyfluorene)] (PFN) layer is introduced to further reduce the dark current. The thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS, (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, PC61BM and PFN layers are measured to be 30\u202fnm, 60\u202fnm, 25\u202fnm and 15\u202fnm, respectively. The corresponding energy band diagram of the control PSCs is given in Fig. 1(b). On the basis of the control PSCs, the proposed metallic NP modified PSCs are realized via spin-coating the synthesized AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 solution on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer.\nThe details of the fabrication of the proposed PSCs are as follows. The ITO glass substrate is cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized water, isopropanol, and acetone.

A mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated on the top of the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 1000 rpm for 60 s using a TiO2 (\u223c50 nm particle size) paste. The pristine TiO2 paste was diluted in 2-methoxyethanol (1 g/5 mL). The mesoporous TiO2 layer was annealed at 550 \u00b0C for 30 min in air, which led to a thickness of about 100 nm.

After the FTO etching process, we sequentially washed the etched FTO glass substrates using ultrasonicator with 5% Hellmanex soap, ethanol, acetone, and then treated the FTO glass substrates by Ar plasma to remove the organic residues. A dense TiO2 electron conducting layer with a \u223c50\u202fnm-thickness was deposited on the partially etched the FTO glass substrate by a spray pyrolysis deposition method with a 20\u202fmM of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (Aldrich) solution at 450\u202f\u00b0C.

A class-A solar simulator with a 1000\u202fW Xenon lamp (Peccell, PEC-L01) was employed as a light source. Its light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G 1 sun light intensity (100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122) using a calibrated Si-reference cell certificated by JIS. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900\u202fnm on an incident photon-to-current conversion equipment (HS technologies).

The treated perovskite films for characterization were prepared by removing gold and Spiro-OMeTAD with tape and chlorobenzene respectively unless otherwise stated.\n\nTheoretical calculations for the treated perovskite materials were performed using density functional theory (DFT) within generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh functional, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) []. All the structures of the compounds in this work were fully relaxed until energy and force converged to 10\u22125\u00a0eV and 0.001\u00a0eV\u00a0\u00c5\u22121, respectively. Long range van der Waals dispersion was also considered in this calculation by using empirical correction in Grimme's scheme []. For the lattice relaxation, we choose the most stable cell with orthorhombic Pnma spacegroup. A 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 Monkhorse-pace mesh was chosen for k-sampling of the Brillouin zone. For the Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 supercell was used with canonical ensemble to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the material. Each time step was set to 1.0 fs, and simulations were conducted for 5\u00a0ps\u00a0at 400\u00a0K.\n\nX-ray diffraction pattern (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab) of the perovskite films deposited on FTO glass substrates was obtained with an XRD facility with monochromatic CuK\u03b1 (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00.154\u00a0nm) excitation source at a scan rate of 1.5\u00b0 min\u22121 and step size of 0.02\u00b0. The morphology of the thin film samples was measured using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Joel 7001F) at an acceleration voltage of 5\u00a0kV. The powder samples were diluted in chlorobenzene to obtain their transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Joel 2100). First Ten Angstroms dynamic contact angle analyser (FTA 200) was employed to measure the water contact angles and evaluate the hydrophobicity of the perovskite and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD surface at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS, HeI as resonance line, photo energy 21.22\u00a0eV) were measured through Kratos AXIS Supra photoelectron spectrometer. Ultraviolet\u2013visible absorbance spectrum of the samples was detected by Cary 50 UV\u2013visible spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of the samples were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse) with excitation at 475\u00a0nm wavelength. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was tested by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLSP-900, Edinburgh Instrument) with a 377\u00a0nm pulsed diode laser excitation source. The obtained data were analysed following a bi-exponential equation bellow. I(t)=A1exp(\u2212t\u03c41)+A2exp(\u2212t\u03c42)+A0\nThe current-voltage (J-V) plots of perovskite solar cells was tested under irradiation of 100\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122 (AM 1.5, 1 sun) through a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A, Newport) equipped with 450\u00a0W Xenon lamp. The controlled active area of the device was 0.115\u00a0cm2 with a black mask to avoid scattered light. The scan rate in the J-V measurement was 100\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121. No preconditioning such as light soaking or voltage bias was applied with the devices. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) of the electron-only devices was measured in the dark with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400, SMU Instrument). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) system (EQE/IQE 200B, Newport) under AC mode was used to measure the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was performed with the devices under open-circuit voltage condition in a frequency range from 1\u00a0MHz to 0.1\u00a0Hz by an electrochemcial workstation (BioLogic) under different illumination intensities controlled by neutral density optical filters. The J-V plots of the solar cells under different light intensity were also measured to obtain relationship of V oc vs illumination intensity. The stability of device performance against high humidity was monitored by periodically measuring the J-V plots of PSCs without encapsulation stored in a custom-built humidity-controlled chamber (relative humidity> 65% for 968\u00a0h (~40 days).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: ,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbBr0.5I2.5,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: CsFAMAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Undoped,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 45,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: FK209; Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: E-beam evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25; 25,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1000,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 17.2,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 90,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.115,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The ink preparation procedures for GNF and the 2H-MoS2 flakes, by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite and bulk MoS2 respectively, and have been prepared according to a previously described procedure . For the buffer layer deposition, 150\u00a0\u03bcL of the 2H-MoS2 ink is spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 2000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0s. The morphology of the buffer layer has been already studied elsewhere . Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements are performed with a commercial apparatus (Arkeo \u2013 Cicci Research s.r.l.) composed by a 0.3\u00a0m focal length spectrograph with a photon counting unit. The substrates are excited by a green (532\u00a0nm) laser at 45\u00b0 of incidence with a circular spot diameter of 1\u00a0mm. The optical coupling system is composed by a lens condenser and a long pass filter.\n\nPatterned F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses are first washed with a liquid detergent dissolved in deionized water and then cleaned by ultrasonic bath with acetone and IPA for 10\u00a0min. The compact TiO2 blocking layer (c-TiO2) is deposited by spray pyrolysis with a solution of acetylacetone (2\u00a0mL), titanium diisopropoxide (3\u00a0mL) and ethanol (45\u00a0mL) at 480\u00a0\u00b0C. In the ref-PSC, the c-TiO2/FTO substrate is coated by a thin m-TiO2 porous film (\u223c150\u00a0nm) deposited by spin coating a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18 NR-T paste diluted in ethanol 1:5 in wt.) at 4000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0s. The graphene doped m-TiO2 is produced by adding 1% v/v of graphene ink to TiO2 diluted paste. The subsequent sintering at 480\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min is performed in air. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer is deposited onto mesoscopic TiO2 by the sequential deposition of PbI2 (500\u00a0g\u00b7L\u22121, in dimethylformamide) and CH3NH3I (10\u00a0g\u00b7L\u22121 in IPA) in a nitrogen filled glovebox system. The supersaturated PbI2 solution is first deposited by spin coating at 6000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0s and then directly dipped into the CH3NH3I solution for 15\u00a0min. During the second step theCH3NH3PbI3 layer formation is completed by annealing at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and by rinsing with anhydrous IPA. Then, the 2H-MoS2 flakes in IPA and spiro-OMeTAD (73.5\u00a0g\u00b7L\u22121 in chlorobenzene solution doped with TBP (26.77\u00a0\u03bcL\u00b7mL\u22121), LiTFSI (16.6\u00a0\u03bcL\u00b7mL\u22121) and a Cobalt (III) FK209 complex (7.2\u00a0\u03bcL\u00b7mL\u22121)) are sequentially deposited by spin coating at 2000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0s in a glovebox. Finally, the device was completed by the HV thermal evaporation of a gold counter electrode (100\u00a0nm) on an active area of 0.1\u00a0cm2 defined by a shadow mask. The devices were encapsulated with a glass lid sealed on the device only on the substrate edge.\n\nCurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of PSCs are measured under simulated AM 1.5\u00a0G solar light at 1000\u00a0W\u00b7m\u22122 irradiance generated by a solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000, class A). The system is calibrated with a certified reference Si Cell (RERA Solutions RR-1002) and devices are measured using a mask to define the active area. A modular testing platform (Arkeo-Cicci research s.r.l.) is employed to perform transient photo-voltage (TPV), stability at the maximum power point (MPP) and to determine the VOC and JSC dependence from the illumination intensity. The system is equipped with a white LED array (4200\u00a0K) tuneable up to the optical power density of 2000\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122 and with a high-speed source-meter unit. The set-up allows measuring up to four devices in parallel. High perturbation TPV tests allow recording VOC decay and rise profiles by switching the light intensity from dark to 1 SUN (1000\u00a0W\u00b7m\u22122) (for more details, see reference39). The aging test under prolonged sun irradiation is realized by employing a high-power white LED (Bridgelux \u2013 50C10K0 @5000\u00a0K) calibrated at 1 SUN in ambient atmosphere and temperature. A Perturb&Observe algorithm is used to track the MPP trend with a refresh time of 1\u00a0s, while a new I\u2013V scan is recorded under LED illumination every 20\u00a0min. During the 24\u00a0h light-soaking aging test, the temperature was retained constant at room temperature by a water-refrigerated stage.\n\nFor the XPS depth profile analysis (K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific), glass-sealed solar cells were stored in inert ambient for 48\u00a0h after the fabrication in the case of reference devices or subjected to light-soaking-aging test. After the glass lid encapsulation removal, the devices were analyzed by alternating ion sputtering with low-energy (500\u00a0eV) Ar+ beam and XPS analysis performed in the \u201csnapshot\u201d mode with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray beam with a spot size (analysis area) of 200\u00a0\u03bcm and a raster area of 1\u00a0mm. The snapshot mode allows acquiring single spectra (C 1s, O 1s, Au 4f, Pb 4f, I 3d and Sn 3d) with a good energy resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in only a few minutes. The atomic percentages are evaluated at each profile step by peak fitting using Avantage software after Shirley background subtraction. ToF-SIMS 3D imaging was performed with a dual beam ToF-SIMS (TOFSIMS IV from Ion-TOF GmbH, M\u00fcnster, Germany) spectrometer equipped with a 25\u00a0keV Bi3 + beam for the analysis and a 500\u00a0eV Cs+ ion beam for the sputtering operated in the non-interlaced bunched mode. These conditions allow for an in-plane resolution of \u223c1\u00a0\u03bcm, an in-depth resolution of \u223c1\u00a0nm and a mass resolution M/\u0394M of \u223c5000. ToF-SIMS profiles are built by selecting the most relevant molecular ions in the mass spectra (0\u00a0<\u00a0m/z\u00a0<\u00a0800) and displaying their evolution as a function of the sputtering time. The sputtering time can't be directly translated into a depth (z direction) because of the variable sputtering rate when profiling soft (organic) and hard (inorganic) layers.

The devices were illuminated through a shadow mask, yielding an active area of 0.175 cm2. To fabricate the solar cell, a 50 nm compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin coating (2000 rpm 30 s) a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) in ethanol containing 350 \u03bcL TTIP in 5 mL EtOH containing 0.013 M HCl.

To interconnected TiO2 layer, the substrate was further treated with 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 oC for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. The equimolar 1 M RbI and PbI2 were dissolved in the DMF solvent. The solution was spin coated on the N type TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by the annealing process at 100 oC for 30 min. A solution for spiroMeOTAD coating was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiroMeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 \u03bcL of 4-tert- butyl pyridine (TBP) and 17.5 \u03bcL of lithium bis(trifl uoromethanesulfonyl) imide solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, 99.8%)) were added .

The LED was operated with a potentiostatic feedback loop to control the stationary DC voltage and a concurrent sinusoidal modulated AC voltage. The AC amplitude was fixed at 10% of the stationary DC value. The solar cell was placed under the potentiostat unit. IMPS measured the periodic photocurrent response of the cell to the variation of light intensity, while the IMVS experiment was used to measure the periodic modulation of the photovoltage under the change of light intensity modulation. The real and imaginary part of the modulated photovoltage and photocurrent of the IMVS and IMPS were calculated with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm program.

Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS, model AXIS-NOVA, Kratos) spectra of the ITO surface were studied to determine HOMO level and work function of RbPbI3 in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). The base pressure of the chamber was 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 Torr, which rose to 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr during the Ar-ion sputtering due to Ar-gas backfilling. During the UPS measurement the pressure went to the high 10\u22129 Torr range mainly due to the He. The He I line at 21.2 eV was taken as the excitation source for the UPS. The X-ray source was the Al K\u03b1 line at 1478 eV. The optical constant of RbPbI3 thin film was measured at room temperature and low humidity (< 25% RH) by the VASE-ellipsometer (J. A.

Paratone-N oil is also stable 298 K and 450 K, and protection from the nitrogen stream was accomplished using a Cryojet-5 device (Oxford Instrument Inc.; temperature range 85\u2013500 K)) and the diffraction data was measured at 100 K, 298 K, and 450 K with synchrotron radiation (\u03bb = 0.61000 \u00c5) on a ADSC Quantum-210 detector at BL2D SMC with a silicon (111) double crystal monochromator (DCM) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory Korea. The PAL BL2D-SMDC program was used for data collection (detector distance 63 mm, omega scan; \u2206\u03c9 = 3\u00b0, exposure time 1 s per frame), and the HKL3000sm (Ver. 703r) was used for cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The crystal structure of the RbPbI3 was solved by the direct method with the SHELXT-2014 program and refined by full-matrix least-squares calculations with the SHELXL-2014 program package .\n\nThe calculations of DFT were done using a highly precise full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method with local density approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation potential. Muffin-tin radii of 3.0 a.u. (Rb), 2.50 a.u. (Sn and Pb), and 2.35 a.u. (I) were used with cutoffs for basis expansion and charge, potential representation of 14.82 and 144 Ry, respectively. Summation in reciprocal space was performed with 20 k points in the irreducible wedge. All atomic positions were fully relaxed with a force criteria of 1 \u00d7 10-3 eV/\u00c5. The convergence criteria in our calculations are 10-4 htr/(a.u.)3 in all cases; the difference in the charge density for two successive iterations is less than that value. There are two means of determining the convergence criteria: (i) the charge density difference, and (ii) the total energy difference between two successive iteration steps, with the former depending on how we established the charge density criteria. As the systems are all insulators, that would be sufficient. Additional information was already given in the \u201cComputational Methods\u201d section, where we discuss the use of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown | TiCl4,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: RbPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: RbPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 30,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25.0; 25.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1440,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 1.02,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 98,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.175,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.

The process of preparing CuSCN on ITO was similar to previous reports. CuSCN dissolved in aqueous ammonia (10 mg mL\u22121) was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s in ambient air and then the films were annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 20 min on a hotplate in air.

All solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nThe process for fabricating the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor and films was exactly the same as that described in the previous work. Mixed perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, narrow-bandgap perovskite Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3, and WBG perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 were fabricated via a one-step method reported elsewhere. The 0.1 M sol\u2013gel NiOx precursor as a HTL was prepared by dissolving 24.88 mg of nickel acetate tetrahydrate and 6 \u03bcL of ethanolamine in 1 mL of ethanol, and then stirring at 65 \u00b0C for 2 h.

The CsFAPbI3 film was thermally annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min. In the solvent vapor annealing process, the perovskite films were placed on top of a hotplate and covered with a 100 mL glass Petri dish. Approximately 1 \u03bcL of DMSO:water mixed solvent was added to the center of the Petri dish during the thermal annealing process so that the mixed vapor was well evaporated inside the Petri dish, ensuring that it contacted the perovskite layer. More details of the perovskite film fabrication methods are provided in the ESI.\u2020 The PCBM solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 100 \u00b0C for 20 min. The BCP solution was then spin-coated directly onto the PCBM layer at 4000 rpm for 35 s. The PCBM was dissolved in CB with a concentration of 20 mg mL\u22121, and BCP was dissolved in ethanol with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL\u22121. In the final step, a 100 nm-thick layer of Ag was thermally deposited onto the substrates as cathodes at a pressure less than 10\u22126 Torr inside a vacuum thermal evaporator.\n\nGIWAXS measurements. 2D-GIWAXS measurements were performed at the PLS-II 5A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea. 2D-GIWAXS images were collected at 11.57 keV with a MAR charge coupled device (CCD) (sample-to-detector distance: 283.447 mm).\nNEXAFS spectroscopy. Carbon K-edge NEXAFS measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 4D beamline of the PAL in Korea with a p-polarized photon beam. Angle-dependent NEXAFS spectra were recorded using several X-ray incidence angles of 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 55\u00b0, and 70\u00b0.\n\nThe J\u2013V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200 source meter under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm\u22122) light simulated using an Oriel solar simulator (Newport, class AAA solar simulator).

The substrates were sonicated for one hour in RBS\u00ae detergent solution (2 vol%), rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then ultrasonicated in absolute ethanol, dried and heated at 500 \u00b0C for cleaning. A TiO2 hole blocking layer was prepared by spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) at 450 \u00b0C employing a precursor solution made from 0.6 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetyl acetonate) (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.4 mL of acetyl acetone (Sigma Aldrich), employing 9 mL of absolute ethanol as a solvent and O2 as a carrier gas. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was prepared by spin-coating a solution of TiO2 paste (30 NR-D from Dyesol) in absolute ethanol (1:7 by weight) at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the films were sintered in a sequential heating process (5 min at 125 \u00b0C, 5 min at 325 \u00b0C, 5 min at 375 \u00b0C, 15 min at 450 \u00b0C and 30 min at 500 \u00b0C). Then, the samples were transferred into a glovebox to continue the device preparation. MAPbI3 solution was prepared by mixing an equimolar concentration (1.42 M) of PbI2 (TCI Chemicals), methyl ammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol) and DMSO (anhydrous) in DMF. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the mesoporous TiO2 substrates and a few seconds later, washed by dripping 0.5 mL of anhydrous diethylether to induce the intermediate adduct formation of the films, as reported previously. Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene) from Merck was employed as a hole transport material. 110 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene containing tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (FK209, Dyesol), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Sigma Aldrich) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, Sigma Aldrich 96% of purity) as additives in relative molar concentrations of 5%, 50% and 330% respectively, with respect to Spiro-OMeTAD. Then, 35 \u03bcL of that solution were deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, 100 nm of gold was thermally evaporated under vacuum as the top contact of the solar cells.\n\nDevices were hermetically transferred to a Savannah 200 ALD system from Ultratech/Cambridge Nanotech, embedded into an MBraun glovebox, to deposit a ca. 16 nm-thick Al2O3 encapsulation layer. Trimethylaluminium (TMA, AlMe3, from Sigma Aldrich) and H2O were respectively used as Al and O precursors and kept at room temperature. Nitrogen (N2, 99.9999%, Air Liquide) was used as both carrier and purging gas. For encapsulation purposes, ALD cycles (H2O pulse/N2 purge/TMA pulse/N2 purge) with a typical time of 30 s were repeated 250 times (number of cycles) for a total run duration of approximately 2 hours with an average Growth Per Cycle (GPC) of \u223c0.64 \u00c5 per cycle for a final thickness of \u223c16 nm. The deposition temperature was set at either 60 \u00b0C or 90 \u00b0C. Samples were taken out of the reactor right after the end of the run. For the devices containing the ALD-Al2O3 layer used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization, the number of cycles of that process was carefully reduced to prepare films only \u223c2 nm thick. The glovebox with the Savannah system is located inside a cleanroom environment, so as to ensure a low level of particle contamination. Besides, the reactor contamination is particle-controlled so as not to add any particles to the thin film encapsulation process.\n\nThe reliability of the ALD-Al2O3 encapsulation process was evaluated by comparing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs before and after the ALD-Al2O3 step. PSC fabrication and characterization were done at IPVF whereas ALD-Al2O3 encapsulation was accomplished at CEA-LETI. Samples were shipped under an inert atmosphere from IPVF to CEA-LETI after an initial J\u2013V characterization (before ALD-Al2O3 encapsulation) and shipped back to IPVF for further characterization (after ALD-Al2O3 encapsulation). To elucidate the origin of efficiency losses during the encapsulation process, reference PSC samples were fabricated and shipped together with the samples destined to be encapsulated. Accordingly, different kinds of reference samples were distinguished: reference samples with original efficiency or simply reference samples (coded as \u201cRef\u201d), samples shipped to CEA-LETI and stored inside a glovebox under a protecting N2 atmosphere (coded as \u201cShipment\u201d) and samples shipped to CEA-LETI and introduced inside the ALD reactor and heated under the same heating protocols used for the encapsulation process but without being exposed to ALD precursors/chemicals (coded as \u201cH@T\u201d). This way, we were able to discriminate the intrinsic degradation of PSCs (in Shipment) from the degradation related to the heating protocols of the ALD process (H@T) and the one associated with the combined effect of heating and ALD precursors (coded as \u201cALD-Al2O3@T\u201d). Long-term stability tests were performed by comparing the photovoltaic performances of the encapsulated devices and reference ones after long term storage (2256 hours, \u223c94 days). For this, both ALD-Al2O3 encapsulated and reference samples were stored in a normal air atmosphere (no moisture or oxygen control, relative humidity around 80%) in a laboratory room to check environmental stability of the encapsulated devices vs. reference ones. The stability results are considered as the mean of four encapsulated solar cells.\n\nFor J\u2013V characterization, an AAA sun simulator (Oriel Sol3A) with an AM1.5G spectrum (1 sun) was used as a light source. A digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400) was employed to realize a voltage sweep rate of \u223c85 mV s\u22121 (unless different conditions are explicitly specified) while the generated photocurrent of the solar cell was recorded. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were acquired on an Oriel IQE200 system equipped with a source meter (Keithley 2400) using a digital lock-in amplifier (Oriel Merlin) without any additional light bias. For chronopotentiometry measurements, consecutive cycles of 30 minutes were carried out during 33.5 h. In this case, PSCs were kept at open circuit conditions with the help of a potentiostat (Autolab) under continuous illumination (0.65 Suns) also with an AM1.5G spectrum. Between cycles, the illumination was always turned on, but the voltage was set to 0 V before starting the next chronopotentiometry step to monitor the transient behavior before reaching VOC. The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2 (4 \u00d7 4 mm) while for J\u2013V, EQE and chronopotentiometry measurements the illuminated area was fixed at 0.09 cm2 (3 \u00d7 3 mm) with a metal black-painted mask.\n\nFor the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments, a monochromatic (\u03bb = 532 nm) pulsed laser beam (TALISKER, Coherent) was used as a light source. The laser was coupled into a single-mode optical fibre connected to a homemade microscope to focus the light on the sample. The photoluminescence decay dynamics were recorded by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). An Aurea infrared single photon detector was coupled to a PicoHarp 300 for opto-electrical conversion of the decay signal to achieve a time resolution of 130 ps. The output signal was normalized and fitted between the peak of the pulse and the end of the signal using a biexponential model (see the ESI\u2020).\n\nXPS measurements were performed on a K-Alpha+ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) spectrometer using a monochromatic Al-K\u03b1 X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The spectrometer was calibrated using the Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha+ procedure and verified on sputter-clean Cu and Au samples following the ASTM-E-902-94 standard procedure. High energy resolution peaks were acquired with a 400 \u03bcm spot size with a Constant Analyser Energy mode of 20 eV and a 0.1 eV energy step size. No low-energy electron flood gun was necessary for the analysis. Quantification was performed based on the peak areas after a Shirley type background subtraction using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Avantage\u00a9 data system.\n\nThe completed devices were observed by SEM with a Zeiss Merlin VP compact microscope.\n\nThe crystalline properties of the absorber were determined by XRD studies with a PanAnalytical Empyrean diffractometer using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: FK209; Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25.0; 25.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 2256,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 77,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.16,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 ohm sq\u22121) were purchased from Ruilong Tech.

A layer of MAPbI3 perovskite planar film was first formed through a standard two-step sequential deposition method. Briefly, PbI2 and MAI were dissolved into anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and anhydrous 2-propanol with concentrations of 450 mg mL\u22121 for PbI2 and 40 mg mL\u22121 for MAI, respectively. Both solutions and substrates were heated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min before being used. The PbI2 solution was spun on the preheated substrate (5000 rpm for 40 s) and then annealed at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. The MAI solution was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 film (6000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 100 \u00b0C for 2 hours. A mixed solvent (70 \u03bcL DMF in 1 mL IPA) was then spin coated onto the perovskite thin film (4000 rpm for 30 s) and then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 5 min. The thickness of MAPbI3 NWs was \u223c420 nm.\n\nITO-coated glass substrates were first ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol in turn, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 60 min. After filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter, the PEDOT:PSS layer (30 nm) was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 120 \u00b0C for 15 min. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For the devices based on the planar film, the MAPbI3 perovskite layer (\u223c350 nm) was prepared following two-step solution deposition, as described in our previous work. After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the solution of PC61BM (20 mg mL\u22121 in chloroform) or P(NDI2OD-T2) solution (15 mg mL\u22121 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene) with different doping ratios of N-DPBI was then spin-coated on top of the formed perovskite layers. The thickness of P(NDI2OD-T2) was 160 nm. Afterward, opaque Ag (150 nm) was deposited using a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10\u22126 torr). The ALD Al2O3 film (50 nm) was prepared following our previous procedures. To eliminate the Jsc from regions outside the active area, illumination masks with aperture sizes of 0.12, 1.2, or 5.04 cm2 were used.\n\nA 100 nm thick Al2O3 gate dielectric was deposited by ALD at 200 \u00b0C on a heavily doped p-type Si wafer that served as a back gate electrode. Afterward, the perovskite layer was deposited. Au metal contacts were subsequently deposited as the source/drain electrodes by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and the channel width (W) were 60 \u03bcm and 3500 \u03bcm, respectively. Electrical characterization was carried out under vacuum using an Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The field-effect mobility was extracted from the following equation in the saturation regime, ID = \u03bcCi(W/2L)(VG \u2212 VT), where ID is the drain current, \u03bc is the field-effect mobility, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric, and VG is the gate voltage.\n\nThe device characteristics were evaluated under ambient conditions under an AM1.5G AAA class solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI Electric. Co. Ltd.) with an intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122.

IPCE spectra were measured in DC mode using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination of monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a monochromator. Steady-state PL spectra were measured at room temperature by using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) with a 150W Xe lamp as an excitation source at 600 nm. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were recorded by using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Edinburgh Instruments FL920), and the excitation light pulse was provided using a picosecond diode laser at a wavelength of 450 nm, and the signal was monitored at \u223c760 nm. The PL lifetimes of the samples were calculated by fitting the experimental decay transient data to the double-exponential decay model. The surface morphology of the films was studied using tapping mode AFM using a Digital Instrument D3100CL. The electrical conductivities of the thin films were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400). SEM was conducted with a field-emission SEM (S-4800, Hitachi) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with the samples coated with \u223c3 nm of platinum. The XRD patterns were recorded using a multi-function high power X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 DISCOVER SSS) as the CuK source (wavelength = 1.541 \u00c5). The film thicknesses were measured by using a Tencor Alpha-step surface profiler.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: P(NDI2OD-T2),\n ETL_additives_compounds: N-DPBI,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA >> DMF; IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 70.0 >> 100.0 >> 100.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10.0 >> 10.0 >> 5.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 30.0; 30.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1500,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 16,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 80,\n Cell_area_measured: 1.2,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "A perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing BAI (99%, TCI), FAI (99%, MaterWin), PbI2 (99%, Alfa Aesar), and (NH2)2CS (99%, Sigma) with a molar ratio of 2:2:3:x (x = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, referred to as THA = 0, THA = 0.1, THA = 0.25, THA = 0.5, THA = 0.75, and THA = 1, respectively) in 1 mL of DMF (99%, Aldrich), and stirred overnight in a N2 glovebox at 70 \u00b0C.

The methods of preparing compact TiO2 (bl-TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layers had been described in detail in our previous report. The perovskite films were prepared by one-step spin coating procedure via the hybrid solution. Typically, the CH3NH3I (prepared by the reported procedure ) was mixed with PbCl2 (Alfar Aesar) and PbI2 (Alfar Aesar). The mole ratio of PbCl2:PbI2:CH3NH3I was controlled to be 1:1:4 in DMF (Alfar Aesar). The hybrid solution was kept being stirred at room temperature for 2 h to obtain perovskite precursor solution with varied concentration of 40 wt%, 45 wt% and 50 wt%, respectively. And lastly, the precursor solution was filtered with a PTFE filter (0.45 \u03bcm pore size) to obtain more transparent perovskite precursor solution.\nTo deposit perovskite film, TiO2 substrates and precursor solution were transferred to the glove box with water content less than 50 ppm.

A TiO2 hole blocking layer (bl-TiO2) (60 nm) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s onto the ITO using TDP solution in 1-butanol (0.15 M) and subsequent heating at 125 \u00b0C for 5 min. The process was repeated using a 0.30 M TDP solution. After that, TiO2 paste (1:5 in EtOH) was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the cleaned ITO substrate to form a mesoporous scaffold (meso-TiO2).

The MAPbI3\u2212zClz solution contained the precursors MAI and PbCl2 at a 3:1 molar ratio. During the spin coating process, toluene (500 \u03bcL) was dripped onto the surface at a uniform rate over the last 15 s. The nominal compositions of the MPxMGy films studied are shown in Fig. 2.

The beam was incident on the film surface side and an excitation wavelength of 480 nm was used.\n\nDemonstration solar cells were prepared using MP37.5MG3.0 and compared with control MP37.5 devices. The procedure to prepare the ITO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2/MPxMGy films was described above. CBZ was used as the HTM solvent at room temperature. LiTFSI (4.8 \u03bcL, 520 mg mL\u22121) and TBP (8.0 \u03bcL) were also added to the Spiro solution following our method reported earlier.

All solutions are filtered with a 0.45-\u03bcm PTFE filter before use. CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the reported procedure. For the typical synthesis, 0.3\u00a0mol (38\u00a0mL) methylamine (CH3NH2) solution (33 wt.% in absolute ethanol) was reacted with equimolar (40\u00a0mL) hydroiodic acid (HI) (57\u00a0wt.% in water) with stirring in ice bath for 2\u00a0hr to obtain methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I). Crystallization of CH3NH3I was achieved using a rotary evaporator at 60\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0hr.\nAll the ITO-coated substrates were cleaned with isopropanol, acetone, and distilled water sequentially, and treated with UV-ozone for 20\u00a0min. To prepare NiO HTL, Nickel(II) acetylacetonate was dissolved in ethanol (0.1 mol/L) with the addition of 10\u00a0\u03bcL of HCl (38 wt.%) into the solution. The solution was then stirred in a sealed glass vial overnight. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned and then UV-ozone treated for 15\u00a0min prior to depositing the NiO layer. The NiO layer was then spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass at 5,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s and annealed at 350\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr in air. To prepare crosslinked HTL, a precursor solution of TCTA-BVP mixed with pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) with a molar ratio of 2.2:1 in chlorobenzene (8\u00a0mg/mL of TCTA-BVP) was prepared first. Then the precursor solution (1\u00a0mL) was doped by adding 10\u00a0\u03bcL of t-butylpyridine (TBP) solution and 10\u00a0\u03bcL of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (170\u00a0mg/mL) additives. After shaking for 1\u00a0min, the doped precursor solution was spin-coated on top of perovskite layer at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s and 4,000\u00a0rpm for 5 s. The resulting films were heated on a hotplate in the nitrogen glovebox at a temperature 150\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After cooling, the film was rinsed with toluene on the surface and then spun at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 30 s.\nFor preparation of the perovskite layer, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I with lead(II) iodide (PbI2) at a molar ratio of 1:1.08 in the DMF and DMSO co-solvent (with a volume ratio of 4:1) and stirred at 60\u00b0C overnight. The perovskite precursor solution was then spin-coated onto prepared HTL at 1,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0s and 4,000\u00a0rpm for 45 s. During the last 25\u00a0s of the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with toluene drop-rinsing (0.7\u00a0mL). The as-spun films were annealed at 100\u00b0C for \u223c20\u00a0min.\nFor preparation of the ETL, the HATNASOACRYLATE precursor solution was first mixed with PETMP at a molar ratio of 5:1 in chlorobenzene (15\u00a0mg/mL in 1,4-dichlorobenzene). The precursor solution (1\u00a0mL) was then doped by adding triethylamine with different concentration (1 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 5 wt.%, triethylamine to HATNASOACRYLATE). The solution was deposited onto perovskite layer by spin-coating at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s and 4,000\u00a0rpm for 5 s. The controlled PCBM layer (20\u00a0mg/mL in 1,4-dichlorobenzene) was also spin-coated at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s and 4,000\u00a0rpm for 5 s. All of the ETL layer was coated with a bis-C60 surfactant layer. The bis-C60 layer was prepared (2\u00a0mg mL\u22121) in isopropyl alcohol and spin-coated at 3,000\u00a0rpm for 30 s. The all-crosslinked CTLs flexible PVSCs used an ITO-coated PEN substrate, which were cleaned with isopropanol, acetone, and distilled water sequentially, and treated with UV-ozone for 20\u00a0min. The crosslinked HTL (c-TCTA-BVP), MAPbI3 perovskite layer, and crosslinked ETL (c-HATNA) were deposited sequentially using the same procedure described above. Finally, for all devices above, a 150-nm-thick top Ag electrode was evaporated under high vacuum (<2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22127 torr) through a shadow mask with 1.4-mm wide patterned ITO bar and the 8\u00a0mm length. For all studied devices, the device area was defined as 9.6\u00a0mm2 by metal shadow mask.\nAll the J-V curves in this study were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and the scan rate was kept at 0.1\u00a0V s\u22121. The J-V curves and steady-state power output of the PVSCs were measured by a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination by a 450-W Oriel xenon lamp with an AM 1.5G filter solar simulator (100 mW cm\u22122), and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector (equipped with a KG-5 filter), which can be traced back to the standard cell of National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The EQE spectra were measured using a setup consisting of a xenon lamp (Oriel, 300 W) as a light source, a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 130), a chopper with a frequency of 100\u00a0Hz, a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Corp SR830), an SMU (Keithley 2400), and a NIST-certified Si photodiode (Thorlabs FDS 100-CAL) for calibration. White light bias was applied using a 50-W LED fiber-optic illuminator; no change was observed in the EQE measurements with and without white light bias. The EQE spectrum was integrated over AM 1.5G photon flux to attain photocurrent density. The fluctuation of xenon arc lamp source was within 5% during the entire period of measurement. Charge-carrier mobilities (\u03bc) were calculated from the J-V characteristics using the SCLC method with the Mott-Gurney equation for the current density J SCLC expressed as J=9\u025br\u025b0\u03bcV28L3, where \u025b 0 is the vacuum permittivity, \u025b r is the dielectric constant of the film, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The morphology of the perovskite films were characterized by scanning EM (FEI Sirion XL30 scanning electron microscope operated at 5 kV). The absorption spectra were measured by a Varian Cary 5000\u00a0UV-Vis-NIR. Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected by a Bruker Vector 33 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer.

That is, the MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.15\u202fM PbI2 and MAI (methyl ammonium iodide) (molar ratio, 1:1) into anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1). The solution was stirred at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh in a glove box to form the perovskite solution. The perovskite precursor solutions were then spin-coated on the HTL-coated substrates.

The ITO glass substrate was patterned through an etching process, follow by cleaning and treatment with plasmas for 5\u202fmin. The HTL material (PEDOT:PSS or HTM-1\u20133) was deposited on the ITO through spin-coating (4000\u202frpm, 30\u202fs) and annealing (120\u202f\u00b0C, 20\u202fmin) for PEDOT:PSS and through spin-coating (2000\u202frpm, 20\u202fs) for the HTM series; the film thickness of PEDOT:PSS and the HTM series were 40 and 10\u202fnm, respectively. A perovskite solution was spin-coated at 2000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs and then at 4000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs, and then washed with toluene; the thickness of the resulting film of perovskite was approximately 500\u202fnm. Solutions of PC61BM was spin-coated at 2000\u202frpm for 20\u202fs and BCP was then spin-coated at 6000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs; the thicknesses of the resulting PC61BM and BCP films were 35 and 2\u202fnm, respectively. Finally, the device was completed by depositing a 100-nm-thick layer of Ag through thermal evaporation (<10\u22126\u202ftorr). The active area of the device was 0.1\u202fcm2. In this work, all devices were fabricated under the optimized film thickness. For example, the PEDOT:PSS with 40\u202fnm film thickness was prepared according to the pervious literature (Hsu et al., 2015). In addition, the film thickness of the bifluorenylidene-based HTMs (HTM-1\u20133) were firstly referring to the literature that used HTM-3 as hole transporting material in n-i-p PSC (Rakstys et al., 2016). Then, optimized the cell performance as the film thickness at around 10\u202fnm.\n\nThe hole transport mobilities of the HTMs were determined through space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Hole-only devices were prepared having the configuration ITO/HTM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glass substrate was patterned through etching, followed by cleaning and treatment with plasmas for 5\u202fmin. A solution of the HTM was then spin-coated (2000\u202frpm, 20\u202fs) onto the ITO. MoO3 and the Ag electrode were thermally evaporated to give films having thicknesses of 3 and 100\u202fnm, respectively. The Mott\u2013Gurney equation was used to calculate the hole-only mobilities in the SCLC regime (Eq. (1)) (Goh et al., 2005).

Next, a thin layer (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 130 \u00b0C for 20 min. Then, the MAPbI3\u2212xClx based perovskite layer was deposited using a sequential deposition method according to the previous literature. 1.25 M PbI2 was dissolved in a mixture solvent of DMF and DMSO (v/v = 9:1) and stirred at room temperature. MAI and MACl (m/m = 9:1) were dissolved in IPA with a total concentration of 30 mg mL\u22121. The PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at a speed of 3000 rpm for 60 s and heated at 70 \u00b0C to remove the solvent. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture solution of MAI and MACl was spin-coated onto the PbI2 film at a speed of 4000 rpm for 20 s. The perovskite film was annealed at 85 \u00b0C for 1 h. PPDIDTT was dissolved in chloroform (CF) with different concentrations (5, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.2 mg mL\u22121) and spin-coated on the top of the perovskite film at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, PC61BM (dissolved in CB, 20 mg mL\u22121) and Bphen (dissolved in IPA, 0.5 mg mL\u22121) were spin-coated at a speed of 1000 rpm for 60 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Finally, an 80 nm thick Ag counter electrode was deposited on the top of the buffer layer by thermal evaporation at the pressure of 10\u22126 Torr.\n\nUV-vis absorption spectra (ITO/perovskite and ITO/perovskite/PPDIDTT) were measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) with a wavelength ranging from 350 to 850 nm. SEM images (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PPDIDTT/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag) were characterized using a FEI-SEM (XL 30 S-FEG). AFM images (ITO/perovskite, ITO/perovskite/PPDIDTT, ITO/perovskite/PC61BM and ITO/perovskite/PPDIDTT/PC61BM) were obtained using a Multimode 8 scanning probe microscope (Bruker). FTIR spectra (pellets of PPDIDTT, perovskite and PPDIDTT:perovskite) were obtained using a TENSOR27 (Bruker), and Raman spectra (ITO/perovskite, ITO/PPDIDTT and ITO/perovskite/PPDIDTT) were obtained using a JY HR800 spectrometer. TAS (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PPDIDTT/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag) was performed using an IM6ex electrochemical workstation (Zahner), in which the scanning frequency was set between 0.1 and 106 Hz, and the amplitude of the sine perturbation bias was set to 10 mV. The photovoltaic performance was characterized using a Keithley 2602 system source meter and an Oriel Solar Simulator 91192 with irradiation of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm\u22122, calibrated with the standard silicon reference cell. When testing, individual devices were masked with a black aperture to confine the active area of the device to 0.1 cm2. EQE spectra were measured using a lab-made spectrometer with a wavelength ranging from 350 to 800 nm. The steady-state PL spectra (SiO2/perovskite/PPDIDTT, SiO2/perovskite/PC61BM and SiO2/perovskite/PPDIDTT/PC61BM and SiO2/perovskite) were measured using the PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900) with Xenon as the excitation source (excitation at 550 nm). The detected emission wavelength of the steady-state PL was from 700 to 850 nm. Time-resolved PL decay transient spectra (SiO2/perovskite/PPDIDTT, SiO2/perovskite/PC61BM and SiO2/perovskite/PPDIDTT/PC61BM and SiO2/perovskite) were obtained using a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900), excited using a pulsed diode laser (EPL-445, 0.8 mJ cm\u22122) and measured at 775 nm after excitation at 445 nm.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60 | Bphen,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Cl,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown >> 85.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown >> 60.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "FTO glass was etched with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid (1 M) to house two electrodes, which were cleaned with ultrasonic soap, water, and ethanol bath and then rinsed with deionized water. A 70 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer (cp-TiO2) was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) precursor solution diluted in ethanol (1:39 v:v) at 485 \u00b0C for 30 min. This was followed by the deposition of a 20 mM TiCl4 solution layer, which functioned as an electron transport layer (ETL). The mesoporous TiO2 layer (mp-TiO2) was formed by spin-coating a diluted TiO2 solution (1:8.5 v:v) at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by sintering at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was prepared inside a nitrogen-filled glove box with oxygen and moisture levels <1 ppm by mixing 0.288 g CH3NH3I (dyesol, 99.99%) with 0.831 g PbI2 (Aldrich, 99.999%, ultra-dry) in a 1:1 equimolar ratio.

CH3NH3PbI3 was then spin-coated on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s and at 5000 rpm for 30 s; the anti-solvent toluene was injected for 15 s in the second spin step. The spin-coated perovskite film was dried at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min to remove toluene. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 \u03bcL of tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 17.5 \u03bcL of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (from a stock solution of 520 mg mL\u22121 of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (Aldrich, 99.8%)) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was then spin coated on the MAPbI3 substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s. An ion beam sputtering system was used to deposit the Cu/Cu2O films. The vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr. A copper substrate (99.99% purity) was used as the sputtering target. The Cu/Cu2O films were grown at room temperature (\u223c30 \u00b0C) with different Ar and O2 flow rates with working pressure ranging from 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 Torr to 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 Torr. Finally, the Cu/Cu2O films were deposited on Spiro-OMeTAD to form the counter electrode. For the device without Cu/Cu2O, a 60 nm-thick silver layer was thermally evaporated on Spiro-OMeTAD as the counter electrode.\n\nThe crystallographic properties of the films were determined by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5, D8, Bruker, Germany) at room temperature with a scanning step size of 0.005\u00b0.

Optical transmittance spectra were obtained using a UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (HITACHI U4100) at a fixed incidence angle perpendicular to the film surface in the range of 300\u2013900 nm. The FTO glass was used as a reference for transmittance measurements. The carrier type, carrier concentration, and electrical resistivity were measured using a four-terminal van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. The UPS experiment was performed at beamline 24A of the Taiwan Light Source at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC). A microscopic PL system (MRI, Protrustech Co., Ltd, Taiwan) was used to determine the band gap of the films with a pump wavelength of 532 nm.

The 800 nm laser was split into two portions. An optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light conversion) was pumped by one portion (with an average power of 1 W) of this 800 nm laser. The generated beam with a wavelength of 500 nm serves as the \u201cpump\u201d in the typical pump\u2013probe scheme.

The PET/ITO substrates were cleaned only with detergent and ethanol. TiO2 thin films of different thicknesses were fabricated using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on a flexible indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated conducting glass and/or PET substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 \u03a9 cm\u22122. A pure titanium metal target (Ti) with an area of 2 cm2 and 99.99% purity was used for sputtering. The sputtering chamber was initially evacuated to 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr and then maintained at 10 mTorr by flowing Ar and O2 gases during sputtering. During deposition, the Ar to O2 gas flow rate ratio was set to 8:2 (20% oxygen). The samples were deposited at room temperature with an applied power of 130 W. TiO2 films with three thicknesses of 30, 50 and 100 nm were grown by adjusting the sputtering time and using a quartz thickness monitor placed close to the substrates in the sputtering chamber. The growth rate of the TiO2 film was 0.5 \u00c5 per cycle.\nThe highly uniformly deposited Bl-TiO2 layers on glass/ITO and PET/ITO substrates with different thicknesses (30, 50 and 100 nm) using RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature have been used as an alternative ETL to the conventional methods. The deposited PET/ITO/Bl-TiO2 and/or glass/ITO/Bl-TiO2 substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glove-box for MAPb(I3\u2212xBrx)3 perovskite deposition. Second, a desired mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI2, or PbBr2 in GBL and DMSO solvent was dripped onto the PET/ITO/Bl-TiO2 (1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm2) surface. This substrate was then spun in a spin-coater at speeds of 1000 rpm (10 s) and 4000 rpm (40 s). Third, a solvent that is immiscible with the perovskite materials, such as toluene, was dripped onto the substrate during spin coating. Fourth, the uniformly deposited MAPb(I1\u2212xBrx)3 thin film was dried on a hot plate to obtain crystalline MAPb(I1\u2212xBrx)3 perovskite materials. Fifth, the HTM material (PTAA) from the toluene solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm at room temperature.

The CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml methylamine (CH3NH2) (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid (HI) (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml hydrobromic acid (HBr) (48 wt% in water, Aldrich), respectively, in a 250 ml round-bottom flask in an ice cold solution for 2 h with stirring, followed by solvent evaporation using a rotary evaporator (95 mbar vacuum, 400 rpm rotation) at 60 \u00b0C. The resulting white solid product MAI/MABr was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized using diethyl ether. The fresh fine white crystals were washed three times using diethyl ether and then dried in a vacuum for 24 h. The MAPb(I1\u2212xBrx)3 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving the desired amounts of MAI, MABr, lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) (Aldrich, 99.999%) in anhydrous \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) (7:3 v/v) at 60 \u00b0C overnight. The clear filtered yellow solution was spin coated on the top of the Bl-TiO2 samples by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 40 s, respectively. One drop of toluene was drop-cast during the second spin-coating step followed by a heat treatment on a hot plate for 10 min to form dark-brown colored crystalline MAPb(I1\u2212xBrx)3. The hole transport material (HTM) was prepared by the standard procedure reported elsewhere. 15 mg poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA, EM Index, Mw = 17500 g mol\u22121) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 \u03bcl of a solution of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg cm\u22121) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 \u03bcl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich) and spin-coated on the glass/ITO/Bl-TiO2/MAPb(I1\u2212xBrx)3 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and subsequently evacuated to a pressure of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar. For the Au counter electrode, an 80 nm-thick Au layer was deposited on the top of the HTM over layer by thermal evaporation (growth rate approximately 0.5 \u00c5 s\u22121) at a pressure of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar. The active areas of all devices were 0.03 cm2.\n\nHigh resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with the Cu K line at 1.5410 \u00c5. The cross-sectional images were recorded by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5 G for 10 s, for which the light intensity was adjusted to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm\u22122) through the use of an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900 nm using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. All IPCE spectra were normalized to the measured J\u2013V current for accurate comparison. The IPCE data were collected in the constant energy DC mode with a delay time of 10 ms and a light intensity of 50 \u03bcW cm\u22122. Solid state impedance spectroscopy (ssIS) was conducted using an IviumStat (Ivium Technologies B.V., Eindhoven, the Netherlands) under open-circuit conditions at frequencies ranging from 10\u22121 to 105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. Z-view 2.8d (Scribner Associates) was used to fit the IS spectra to the equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model. The DC bias potential was applied in 0.05 V step intervals.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbBrI2,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMSO; GBL,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PTAA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.03,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion), Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (CB) and N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. CH3NH3I (MAI, 95%) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%) were obtained from Xi'an p-OLED. 2, 2\u2032, 7, 7\u2032-tetrakis (N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9, 9\u2032-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, 99.5%) was supplied by Weihua Solar. Fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) glass with a resistivity of 12\u202fV\u202fcm\u22122 was purchased from Wuhan GeAo Corporation Ltd. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.3\u202fM\u03a9\u202fcm was used in the whole preparation. Other reagents (containing TiCl4 solution and alcohol) were received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corporation, Ltd.\n\nThe FTO substrates were selectively etched in diluted HCl aqueous solution, with moderate Zn powder added in it. The etched substrates were carefully cleaned by foamless eradicator and then were degreased by sonication in water, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, respectively, followed by blow-dried by nitrogen gas and cleaned by UV-ozone cleaning system for 15\u202fmin. The TiO2 monolayer ETLs were prepared by a chemical bath deposition process. Briefly, the FTO substrates were immersed in a beaker filled with 0.05\u202fM titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) aqueous solution, which was then kept at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh in a water bath, resulting in the formation of TiO2 films on the FTO substrates. After the deposition of TiO2 films, the TiCl4-treated FTO subtracts were washed thoroughly with deionized water and alcohol, followed by blow-dried by nitrogen gas and baked on a hot plate at 130\u202f\u00b0C in air for one hour and then cooled down to room temperature in air. The as-prepared samples were named as TiO2 samples.\nA blocking layer of compact SnO2 was formed by spin-coating a SnO2 nanoparticles precursor, which was obtained from Alfa Aesar and was diluted with water (the mass ratio of the purchased SnO2 solution and water was 1:5) before use. The precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the cleaned FTO substrates at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. Subsequently, the samples were baked on a hot plate at 150\u202f\u00b0C in air for 30\u202fmin and then cooled down to room temperature in air. The as-prepared samples were named as SnO2 samples.\nThe TiO2-SnO2 bilayered films were obtained by spin coating the SnO2 nanoparticles precursor solution onto the prepared TiO2 samples directly. All the treatment was exactly same with the monolayer film deposition. The as-prepared samples were named as TiO2-SnO2 samples.\n\nDevices with the n-i-p planar structure of FTO-ETL-MAPbI3-Spiro-OMeTAD-Ag were fabricated by using three different ETLs including TiO2, SnO2 and TiO2-SnO2 films. The ETL coated substrates (TiO2 samples, SnO2 samples and TiO2-SnO2 samples) were transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box to deposit perovskite films and HTLs. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 2.8\u202fg of PbI2 and 1.0\u202fg of CH3NH3I in a 1.5\u202fmL of DMSO and 3.5\u202fmL of DMF mixed solution, followed by being stirred at 70\u202f\u00b0C overnight and then filtered through TPFE filter (0.45\u202f\u03bcm) before use. An anti-solvent method reported in our previous report [38] was conducted to achieve high performance perovskite films. The perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the ETL coated substrates, and then spin-coated at a low speed of 1000\u202frpm for 5\u202fs and a sequential high speed of 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, respectively, during which 130\u202f\u03bcL of chlorobenzene was dripped onto the films 15\u202fs prior to the ending. Then the wet films were baked at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin in the glove box. The HTL was spin-coated onto the perovskite layers at 1500\u202frpm for 45\u202fs from a Spiro-OMeTAD solution. The specific stoichiometric ratio of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution could be described as follows: 72.3\u202fmg Spiro-OMeTAD was added in 1\u202fmL chlorobenzene, with the addition of 17.5\u202f\u03bcL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121) solution and 28.8\u202f\u03bcL tBP.

The scanning speed was 5\u00b0\u202fper minute at the step of 0.02\u00b0. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultrabld, Kratos) was employed to characterize the element composition of the SnO2 nanoparticles. The surface morphologies of the samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6390, JEOL Inc., Japan). The topographic images of the sample were obtained by using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Innova Atomic Force Microscope, Santa Barbara, CA USA) in trapping mode. The absorption and transmission spectra of the samples were acquired by a JASCO V-570 UV/vis/ NIR spectrometer.\nAll the following measurements were tested in ambient environment. The J-V curves measurements of the devices were conducted 24\u202fh after the vacuum thermal evaporation by a PVIV-201\u202fV I-V Station (Newport Oriel) The illumination source was calibrated by using a Si reference cell system (91150\u202fV, Newport) before use.

Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from DyeSol and all the materials were used as received without any further purification. To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, we mixed MAI (159 mg) powder and PbI2 (461 mg) (1:1 molar ratio) in 1 mL mixed GBL:DMSO (0.7:0.3) solvent for the reference perovskite precursor solution.

In a typical process, certain amount of CsBr, AgBr, SbBr3, and BiBr3 powdered precursors were put into a 10\u202fmL glass bottle at the beginning. Then, a 2\u202fmL 180\u202f\u00b0C preheated DMSO solution was added to trigger the dissolution. Following that, the precursors/DMSO mixture was kept on a hot plate at 180\u202f\u00b0C for around 10\u202fmin until the complete dissolution of the precursors.\nAfter the full dissolution of precursors, a frosted quartz slide substrate (with 5\u202fcm in length and 1\u202fcm in width) was dipped into the precursor solution (kept for around 5\u202fs) and then slowly pulled out (with effective coating area around 1\u202fcm2).

Subsequently, 72.3\u202fmg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1\u202fmL of chloridebenze solution was used as hole transport materials with the addition of 28\u202f\u00b5L of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 19\u202f\u00b5L of TSFI-Li acetonitrile (520\u202fmg/mL).

The devices fabricated on the different perovskites were correspondingly labeled.\n\nThe phase structures of the films were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with CuK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f0.15406\u202fnm) operated at 40\u202fkV and 40\u202fmA. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the prepared films were analyzed by field-emitted scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SUPRA 55, Zeiss, Germany). The composition of the film was mapped by an energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis system (EDX, Bruker QUANTAX 200, Bruker, USA). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent 5420, USA) was applied to determine the surface distribution of the films. Photoluminescence (PL) was carried out using a time-resolved and steady-state spectroscope (FluoTime 300, PicoQuant GmbH) from 600 to 800\u202fnm. UV\u2013visible spectra were obtained on a spectrophotometer (UV-3600Plus, Shimadzu, Japan). Current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were tested under simulated AM 1.5G conditions (100\u202fmW/cm2) with a Keithley 2400 source meter under ambient conditions in-house. The voltage was scanned from 0 to 0.70\u202fV with a scan rate of approximately 0.01\u202fV/s.

The TAA monomer (1) was esterified with methanol by refluxing with a catalytic amount of concentrated H2SO4 for 24 h to protect the carboxylic acid group during polymerization. The HT monomer and different mole fractions of the protected monomer 3-thiophene methyl acetate (3TMA, 2) were dissolved in chloroform and then added slowly to an oxidant solution of anhydrous ferric chloride in anhydrous chloroform under an N2 atmosphere at 0 \u00b0C in a two-necked round-bottomed flask and kept under stirring for 24 h. The molar ratio of the oxidant and monomer was maintained at 4:1 in all cases. After the polymerization, a dark red copolymer, namely, P3TMA-co-P3HT (3), was precipitated by adding an excess amount of methanol. Oligomers and residual oxidant were removed by repeated washing of the precipitate with methanol and deionized water, respectively. A deprotection reaction was performed by heating P3TMA-co-P3HT (0.5 g) in 50 mL of a 2 M NaOH solution for 72 h, and it was then filtered to remove insoluble components. The water-soluble part (4) was neutralized by adding a dilute HCl solution. The resulting precipitate (P3TAA-co-P3HT, 5) was washed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum. The whole procedure of synthesizing the copolymers with different compositions is presented in Scheme 1, and the component polymers were also synthesized via the same procedure for comparison purposes.\nThe weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters Instruments) equipped with an ultra-Styragel column with polystyrene as a standard using THF as the eluent at 40 \u00b0C. 1H NMR spectra were used to determine the chemical structures of the copolymers and the mole percentages of the components in the copolymers. The 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1(a\u2013d), ESI\u2020) were in agreement with the structures of the copolymers.\n\nZnO NPs were synthesized via a previously reported procedure.\n\nMAI was prepared using a method reported in the literature.

It was then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a soap solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, each for 10 min, respectively. Then, a thin layer of ZnO nanoparticles was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The procedure was repeated three times to obtain a continuous film. Next, 461 mg lead iodide (PbI2) and 159 mg MAI were dissolved in 1 mL \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) at 70 \u00b0C overnight. The MAPbI3 solution was spin-cast on the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s.

In addition, one reference device was fabricated using spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM and ZnO as the ETM. To prepare a spiro-MeOTAD solution, 80 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 28.5 \u03bcL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 \u03bcL of a solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and coated on the perovskite film by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s.

All steps of the device fabrication were carried out in ambient conditions.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectra of samples were recorded with a 500 MHz Bruker instrument using DMSO-d6 as a solvent. X-ray diffraction data were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (D8 Advance) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation and fitted with a Lynx Eye detector. The data were recorded with a step size of 0.05\u00b0 (2\u03b8). The morphology and microstructural images were studied using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO MA 10). The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a silicon wafer using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in the solid state on a quartz plate using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 8454). The PL spectra of the solid films on a quartz surface were recorded using a Fluoromax-3 instrument (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements of the MAPbI3 film with different HTMs were made with a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system (Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH). Samples were photoexcited using a 440 nm laser beam. The lifetime was calculated by fitting the decay plot generated for the MAPbI3/HTM films with a biexponential decay function of the following form:\nCyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 6002E) consisting of a platinum wire counter electrode, platinum working electrode, and Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode in a three-electrode cell configuration with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal standard at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121. P3TAA-co-P3HT dissolved in THF was cast on the working electrode, which was followed by coating with Nafion.

All solutions were degassed with ultrapure nitrogen, and throughout the experiment a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained.\n\nThe J\u2013V characteristics of the PSCs were studied in ambient conditions using a Keithley 2401 source measurement unit. The cells were illuminated by a 150 W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel Instruments, Newport) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122. The effective cell area was limited to 0.32 cm2 using a non-reflective mask. IPCE measurements were carried out with a Newport 67005 150 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measurement unit operated by Visual Basic software. EIS measurements were performed using a Solartron SI1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under an open-circuit DC bias and at a voltage perturbation of 10 mV.

Samples were spin-coated at the beamline (Chemat), using the same protocol as for the ex situ XRD measurements. The temperature of the custom-built sample holder was controlled by a temperature controller (Digi-Sense) and the temperature was monitored during X-ray data collection. The X-ray beam was approximately 0.5 mm wide and 0.1 mm high, and illuminated the entire length (5 mm) of the sample using an incident angle of typically 0.5\u00b0. For obtaining depth profiles, the incident angle was varied between 0.1\u00b0 and 0.5\u00b0. For all in situ data collection, the sample was moved to a new position after three GIXD patterns were collected, in order to avoid beam damage.\n\n1 inch by 1 inch patterned ITO substrates were cleaned by sonication with Hellmanex 3 surfactant in deionized water, pure deionized water, then ethanol, and UV-ozone cleaned for 5 minutes. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 40 seconds and annealed at 170 \u00b0C for 4 minutes. MAPbI3 thin film with preferential crystallographic orientation was deposited from THTO added solution as described previously. A 2% weight solution of PCBM was spin-coated at 1000 rpm. The metal contacts were deposited by evaporating 50 nm of aluminum at a rate of 0.1 nm s\u22121 in a vacuum of 10\u22126 Torr. Devices utilizing the same exact architecture were fabricated with a randomly oriented MAPbI3 thin film by using the interdiffusion method. Briefly, 1 M PbI2 in DMF was spin-coated at 3000 rpm, followed by 50 mg mL\u22121 MAI in IPA. The film was annealed at 85 \u00b0C for 1 hour.\n\nThe devices were tested with a Keithley source-meter using a scan rate of 1 V s\u22121 under AM 1.5 illumination from a solar simulator (PV Measurements). The light source was calibrated with a reference silicon solar cell (PV Measurements). The device active area was 0.03 cm2. An optical mask was used to block illuminating the non-device area during testing.\n\nSEM images were taken with a Quanta 650 SEM operating at 30 kV. All samples were imaged at four or more locations and pictures presented in this work are representative of typical results near the center of the sample. Samples were prepared in the same manner as for solar cells without the PCBM and Al layers on top of the MAPbI3 layer.\n\nThe MBO value for atom\u2013atom interactions in a (non-periodic) solvent-lead cluster were calculated using an ab initio approach, optimized with the B97-D3 functional and the PWPB95 functional using the Orca DFT package. Electronic structures of the optimized gas phase molecule were used to calculate the MBO of individual atomic interactions between oxygen and the central atom and, subsequently, the \u201cbond unsaturation\u201d value. The bond unsaturation is defined as the formal bond order (two in the case of oxygen) minus the Mayer bond order. Bond unsaturation, rather than the MBO itself is the key quantity, it provides a measure of the driving force for bonding (see the ESI\u2020 for more details).\n\n20 configurations were generated for the coordinated Pb2+ molecule clusters and pure solvent molecule clusters using Packmol, each with a different random seed. Adequate sampling is necessary for the variety of configurations that complexes may assume. Subsequently, the systems were subjected to molecular dynamics minimizations, performed in LAMMPS using OPLS 2005 parameters. The non-periodic DFT code, Orca was used for further geometry optimizations and energy calculations. These optimizations eliminated the congestion on the Pb2+ ion that resulted from the necessity to use a Ba2+ ion (the closest in size to lead) during the MD annealing process, since Pb2+ parameters are not yet available in the OPLS force field. Using these relaxed geometries as starting configurations, further geometry optimization using B97-D3 ( )/def2-TZVP obtained more accurate structures and energies. The enthalpy of solvation was then calculated from the energies of the resulting geometries (see the ESI\u2020 for more details).\n\nDFT calculations for periodic systems were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) package employing a Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional. The ion\u2013electron interactions were described by the projector-augmented wave method using soft potentials. We relaxed all atoms in the system such that the forces were less than 0.01 eV \u00c5\u22121, and the self-consistent field was terminated when the energy is converged to less than 10\u22126 eV. The electronic wavefunction was expanded using plane waves with an energy cutoff of 280 eV. We used a supercell approach to model the different slabs with 20 \u00c5 of vacuum to mitigate interactions between fictitious images along the non-periodic direction of the slab. The cubic phase was modeled using 2 \u00d7 1 surface supercell, while the tetragonal phase was modeled using 2 \u00d7 2 surface supercell. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1) k-grid for the tetragonal (cubic) surfaces, and 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) for the tetragonal (cubic) bulk phases. The THTO molecule was adsorbed on the top and bottom sides of the slab to minimize the dipole of the system along the non-periodic direction.

This was then washed with absolute diethyl ether three times and the as-obtained solid was re-dissolved in 10.0 mL absolute ethanol and precipitated with the addition of 125.0 mL absolute diethyl ether; this procedure was repeated three times. The white powder was collected and dried at 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.\n\nThe PVSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag.

The resulting TiO2 films was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 3 min and then transferred to the glove box. PbI2 was dissolved in dry DMF with a concentration of 463 mg mL\u22121, and MAI was dissolved in anhydrous IPA at 10 mg mL\u22121. MAPbI3 active layer was prepared through a modified solvent annealing two-step method developed by us.

MAPbI3 perovskite layers were thermally annealed on the heating panel at 90 \u00b0C for 30 min to form and crystallize the MAPbI3 active layer. Then, HB-Cz, P3HT or PCz was deposited by spin-coating a 10\u201320 mg mL\u22121 CB solution at 1000 to 3000 rpm for 30 s and the obtained films were annealed at 90 \u00b0C for another 5 min. Finally, the devices were transferred to a vacuum chamber and finished by evaporation of an 80 nm Ag electrode through a shadow mask. The devices were encapsulated in glass by UV-curable resin in the glove box, and measurements were taken in air.\n\n1H and 13C NMR spectra data were recorded on a Bruker AVIII-400 NMR spectrometer at room temperature and were expressed in parts per million (ppm) relative to the internal standard. Molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene standard calibration (Waters high pressure GPC assembly model 1515 pump, refractive index detectors, eluent solvent THF). UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermal apparatus (Switzerland) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was run on a TA Instrument Q20 with scan rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121 under N2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured by a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc.) in the frequency range between 1 and 106 Hz with perturbation amplitudes of 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using a three-electrode cell under N2 atmosphere with CHI 660 electrochemical workstation. The polymer films on a glassy carbon electrode (working electrode) were scanned anodically and cathodically in 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in dry acetonitrile solution with Ag/AgCl and a Pt-wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The tests were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system with the assumption that the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is 4.8 eV under vacuum. The crystal phase of the samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker, D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5, 40 kV, 40 mA) from 2\u03b8 = 5\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 at a scan rate of 0.02\u00b0 s\u22121 at room temperature under ambient conditions. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was obtained via Perkin Elmer photoluminescence. The fluorescence decay traces were measured using a time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh) excited with a 397 nm EPL picosecond pulsed diode laser with a pulse width of 50 ps at room temperature in air. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension Edge SPM System) were performed to characterize the surface morphology of different films.\nSolar-simulated AM 1.5 sunlight was generated with a NEWPORT Sol3A class solar simulator (Newport Corp., Irvine, CA USA) calibrated to give 100 mW cm\u22122 using a NREL-calibrated KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated to be less than 1%. The current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400.

Before their use, the ITO substrates were exposed to UV-Ozone (UVO) for 20 min. The (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios, P VP AI 4083) used in this study, diluted with methanol, was spin-coated onto the UVO-treated ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s and subsequently annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 20 min in a N2-filled glove box. Methylammonium (MA) lead iodide, MAPbI3, perovskite film was grown via an anti-solvent engineering approach. A precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI2 (1.04:1 molar ratio) in a mixture of \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a final concentration of 44 wt%. The precursor solution was spun onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4500 rpm for 20 s in sequence. An appropriate amount of chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the film surface before the end of the second spin-coating step. The as-coated films were then annealed on a hot plate preheated to 100 \u00b0C for 13 min. After cooling to room temperature, the 3\u2032H-cyclopropa[1,9][5,6]fullerene-C60-Ih-3\u2032-butanoic acid 3\u2032-phenyl methyl ester (C60 PCBM, nano-C-PCBM-BF) solution at a concentration of 20 mg ml\u22121 in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the MAPbI3 film at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The ZnO-NP solution (2.5 wt% in 2-propanol, Nanograde N10) was then spin-coated onto PCBM to form a buffer layer at 2000 rpm for 60 s. To fabricate semi-transparent devices, a 250 nm-thick Al-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent conducting layer was deposited onto the ZnO-NP layer via radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The front-contact Ag grids were finally deposited by thermal evaporation for measurement in a substrate configuration (illumination from the opposite side of the substrate). The active area of the semi-transparent cells was about 0.4\u20130.5 cm2, as defined by mechanical scribing. For the opaque devices, a 150 nm-thick Ag electrode as a charge collector was deposited onto the ZnO-NP layer by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask with an aperture size of 0.5 cm2. The active area of the opaque cells, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Ag electrodes, was 0.22 cm2.\n\nThe CISe devices were fabricated with the architecture of SLG/Mo/CISe/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Ni/Al. First, CISe thin films were deposited onto Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates by one-step electrodeposition in a 5.2 mM selenite-based electrolyte using a three-electrode system. Details of the procedure used to fabricate the electrodeposition are described in our previous paper. The as-prepared electrodeposited CISe films were thermally annealed at 580 \u00b0C for 30 min in a Se vapor atmosphere to improve the crystallinity and microstructure of the films. The annealed films were then chemically etched in a 0.1 M KCN solution for 60 s to remove any CuxSe secondary phases. Subsequently, an n-type CdS buffer layer was deposited via chemical bath deposition for ca. 10 min at 60 \u00b0C in a solution containing 2 mM CdSO4, 1.02 M NH4OH, and 84 mM thiourea to form 60 nm-thick layers. The intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) and AZO layers were sequentially deposited using radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The device was then finalized by thermal deposition of the Ni/Al grids.\n\nTo fabricate the monolithic CISe/perovskite tandem devices, the CISe bottom cell and semi-transparent perovskite top cell were combined by having them share the i-ZnO/AZO layers in such a way that the perovskite cell was directly fabricated onto the AZO layer of the CISe solar cell. To avoid thermal degradation of the CISe/CdS junction properties, thermal annealing of the PEDOT:PSS layer was carried out at a comparatively low temperature of 120 \u00b0C for 5 min. The remaining steps of the fabrication procedure were identical to those of the single-junction semi-transparent perovskite cell.\n\nThe cross-sectional morphologies of the perovskite single cells and the tandem cells were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV (FEI, Inspect F). The optical properties of the semi-transparent perovskite devices were characterized with an optical spectrometer (HR2000CG + UV-NIR, Ocean Optics, Inc.). The current density\u2013voltage (j\u2013V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter and a class-A solar simulator (Yamashita Denso, YSS-50A) equipped with a 180 W xenon lamp.

The j\u2013V curves of the perovskite and tandem solar cells were measured with a 100 ms delay time between adjacent data point acquisition in backward and forward scan modes, respectively. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the cells were measured with an incident photon-to-current conversion measurement system G1218a (PV Measurements, Inc.) at a chopping frequency of 4 Hz. The EQE spectra of sub-cells in tandem devices were extracted under highly unbalanced photocurrent conditions using additional light sources with controlled wavelengths. Specifically, the EQE of top cells was measured by saturating the bottom cell current with infrared light applying a long-wave pass filter (RG-830 Filter Glass, 830FG07-25, Andover Corporation), whereas EQE of bottom cells was measured by saturating the top cell current with blue light applying a bandpass filter (S-8612 Filter Glass, S86FG11-25, Andover Corporation). All the j\u2013V and EQE characterizations were carried out under ambient conditions without encapsulations or anti-reflection coatings.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMSO; GBL,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 13,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Al,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.22,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Starting materials were all available commercially and used without further purification if not mentioned specially.

Photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS) instrument was PYS-202 ionization energy test system (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Japan) at the voltage of 100 V, waiting time of 1 s and energy range from 4.0 to 8.5 eV. The time-of-flight (TOF) measurements were performed on TOF401 (Sumitomo Heavy Industries. Ltd. Japan), for which the samples were prepared through spin coating using a structure ITO/HTM (about 1 \u00b5m)/Al (150 nm) with an active area of 3 \u00d7 10 mm2. Surface morphology of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au film was obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, XL30S-FEG, FEI, USA).

Before used, patterned FTO glass was cleaned with mild detergent, rinsed with distilled water for several times and subsequently with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, finally dried under air stream. For fabricating the device, TiO2 compact layer and mesoporous TiO2 layer were deposited on FTO glass in turn as reported . And the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film was subsequently deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 film by using a modified two-step method according to the literatures . For a deposition of HTM layer, BPZTPA or MeO-BPZTPA in chlorobenzene solution was prepared. HTMs were spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film at 2500 rpm for 30 s, and finally an 80 nm-thickness Au layer (Sigma-Aldrich) was deposited on the top of the HTM layer by thermal evaporation under 10\u22126torr vacuum conditions.\n\nFor current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics, the cells were illuminated under 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 G) by an Oriel solar simulator 91160A calibrated with a standard Si reference cell (National Institute of Metrology, China), and the J\u2013V characteristics of the cells were recorded on Keithley 2602 SourceMeter.

Increasing n leads to the desired CZTS film thicknesses. Note, an excess amount of thiourea is used for the purpose to get the CZTS films with a composition close to stoichiometry, because a serious sulfur loss may occur during thermal decomposition [].\n\nMAPbI3 (1.25\u202fM) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 and CH3NH3I with a molar ratio of 1:1 in a mixture solvent of DMF:DMSO (3:1 v/v) under stirring overnight at 65\u202f\u00b0C, for which the CH3NH3I was synthesized in our group [].\nFirst, the MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated onto the CZTS film surface by sequential two rotating steps (first step: 1000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs; second step: 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs), where 350\u202f\u03bcL chlorobenzene (CB) as anti-solvent was dripped onto the rotating substrate during the second rotating step; after the spin-coating, the MAPbI3 film was subjected to a thermal annealing at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin.

The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, detergents/H2O, distilled water, and isopropyl alcohol for 20\u202fmin sequentially, and was then dried by clean N2 flow and treated by UV-ozone for 20\u202fmin. The PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated at a speed of 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, followed by a post-annealing at 150\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin. The perovskite precursor solution with a concentration of 450\u202fmg/ml (550\u202fmg/ml for anti-solvent method) was prepared by mixing PbI2 and CH3NH3I in DMF (the mole ratio CH3NH3I:PbI2\u202f=\u202f1:1). It was vigorously stirred at 65\u202f\u00b0C for 12\u202fh and filtered with a 0.22\u202f\u03bcm PVDF filter before the use. The deposition of perovskite active layer was performed in air ambient (relative humidity of 60% and the room temperature of 20\u202f\u00b0C). The PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate was heated on heating spin-coater for two minutes to ensure the substrate reached the corresponding temperature, and then the mixed precursor solution was spin-coated at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, followed by a heat-treatment at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin in air. After cooling to room temperature, the raw MAPbI3 perovskite films were simply placed in the CH3NH2 gas environment for 2\u202fs\u202fat room temperature [,,]. In an instant, the perovskite films would react with CH3NH2 to form MAPbI3\u00b7xCH3NH2, which is colorless and transparent in liquid form and would spread over the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate. Removed to the ambient quickly, CH3NH2 molecules would depart from the intermediate, and perovskite films turned to dark brown and became shiny. It is necessary to point out that the room temperature and methylamine alcohol solution should be controlled at \u223c20\u202f\u00b0C to prevent too rapid volatilization of methylamine gas from the intermediate, which has an adverse effect on morphology of the films. Preparation process of perovskite films is divided into spin-coating at room temperature without methylamine gas treatment (RT-W/O) and with methylamine gas treatment (RT-MGT), in-situ hot-casting without methylamine gas treatment (HCT-W/O) and with methylamine gas treatment (HCT-MGT).

An ITO/PET (45 \u03a9 \u25a1\u22121) substrate was cleaned by the same procedure. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-tin(IV) (99%, TDMA-Sn, Strem Chemicals Inc.) was used as the Sn precursor and pure O2 (ultra-high pure, Airgas) was used as the oxidizer. Ar (ultra-high pure, Airgas) was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 15 sccm. PEALD SnO2 was deposited at 100 \u00b0C with an Ensure Scientific Group AutoALD-PE V2.0 equipped with a plasma generator. The TDMA-Sn precursor was held at 75 \u00b0C.

A small amount of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) was added into the precursor solution as an additive. It has been shown that the Pb(SCN)2 additive can enlarge the grain size of the resulting perovskite thin films and subsequently improve the cell performance. The solution was stirred for 12 hours on a 60 \u00b0C hot plate before deposition.\n\nThe C60-SAM was purchased and used without further purification. The C60-SAM at a concentration of 4 mg mL\u22121 was dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) under vigorous stirring overnight. The C60-SAM was then deposited onto the SnO2 ESL by a spin coating method as previously reported. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the C60-SAM/SnO2 ESLs first at 500 rpm for 3 s and then at 4000 rpm for 60 s using an anti-solvent technique. Diethyl ether, as the anti-solvent agent, was then drop-cast on the substrate. After spin coating, the perovskite film was annealed at 65 \u00b0C for 2 minutes and then at 100 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. All of these processes were carried out in a N2 filled glove box. Spiro-OMeTAD (Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd., 99.0%) was used as the HSL and deposited on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds.

The perovskite precursor solution contained a mixture of MAI and PbI2 (1:1, molecular ratio) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO 9:1 (v/v). Methylammonium acetate (MAAc) was synthesized according to the reported literature with a slight modification. Briefly, 50 ml of ethanol, 5 ml of acetate (99.5%, Aladdin Reagents), and 12 ml of methylamine (30\u201333 wt% in ethanol, Aladdin Reagents) were added sequentially in a 250 ml round-bottom flask. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then put into a vacuum chamber with a solid desiccant (silica gel). The chamber pressure was maintained at 0.1 MPa for 24 h. The resultant colorless and viscous liquid was stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox for further use.\n\nFTO glass was cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water before using. The FTO was cleaned by UVO for 15 min. Then, the SnO2 nanoparticle film (7.5%), as an ETL, was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, or roller-coated at a speed of 10\u201350 mm s\u22121 using a roller with a groove depth of 6 \u03bcm, and annealed in ambient air at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min.

The scanning step was 40 mV for the J\u2013V curve measurement. Unless specified, a bias scan from 1.2 V to \u22120.2 V was run first (reverse scan) followed by a return back (forward scan) with a delay time of 50 ms. A metal mask with a window of 0.1 cm2 was covered on the light illumination side to define the active area of the cell. The spectral response was measured by an external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurement) with a scanning step of 10 nm. A xenon arc lamp was used as the monochromatic light excitation source and filtered by a double grating. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed by a spectrometer (Edinburgh FS5) at room temperature with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and power of 0.2 mW respectively.

Doping of 5 mol% Li+ into the NiO film was performed to increase the p-conductivity, and doping of 15 mol% Mg+ into the NiO film was performed to adjust the valence band (EVB). The optimization of the NiOx layer with Li+ and Mg+ doping can be found in previous work. After spraying, the film was further annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 15 min to promote NiO crystallization.

The XRD pattern was measured using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The UV-vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV/Vis 3600 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. The steady-state photoluminescence spectrum and quantum efficiency were measured by absolute quantum yield measurement system equipped with a 532 nm continuous wave (CW) laser excitation source, an integrating sphere and fiber-coupled detector (Ocean Optics MayaPro). Time-resolved photoluminescence decay was acquired using a time-correlated single photon counting setup, excited by a 405 nm pulse laser with an excitation energy of 100 \u03bcW and repetition rate of 5 MHz.

To generate the 3MAI:PbAc2\u00b7xH2O precursor solution with x equal to 0, PbAc2\u00b73H2O was first heated to 110 \u00b0C for 12 h in a glove box to obtain anhydrous PbAc2. PbAc2\u00b7xH2O was then obtained by mixing PbAc2 with PbAc2\u00b73H2O at a molar ratio of (3 \u2212 x):x. Finally, MAI and PbAc2\u00b7xH2O were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide at a 3:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 45 wt% (optimal x = 2.8).\n\nThe device structure is ITO/HTL/perovskite CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, in which HTL is one of NiPcS4, PEDOT:PSS, or mixed NiPcS4\u2013PEDOT:PSS. Patterned ITO coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The substrate was then desiccated in an oven, before treating in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for about twenty minutes. Pristine PEDOT:PSS, NiPcS4, or mixed PEDOT:PSS\u2013NiPcS4 aqueous solutions filtered by a 0.45 \u03bcm filter tip were spin-coated at around 4000 rpm for approximately 50 seconds on ITO electrodes, before baking at 140 \u00b0C for about 20 minutes in the ambient atmosphere. Subsequently, the substrates were shifted to a nitrogen-filled glove-box, where a \u2248400 nm-thick CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on the surface of either the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer, NiPcS4 layer or mixed NiPcS4\u2013PEDOT:PSS layer through a one-step solution casting approach. Detailed procedures were according to our previously reported method: perovskite films were spin-coated from set 80 \u00b0C precursor solutions at a speed of around 4000 rpm for about 50 seconds, in which the substrate temperature was maintained at 90 \u00b0C; then, they were annealed on a hotplate at 90 \u00b0C for another 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, PC61BM (dissolved in CB, 20 mg mL\u22121) was spin-coated over the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for another 30 seconds, and finally annealed at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, C60 (20 nm), BCP (8 nm) and the metal silver (100 nm) electrode were thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber at pressure set at <4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa through a shadow mask. Photoactive regions of the devices were 0.08 cm2.\n\nThe J\u2013V measurements of the devices under AM1.5 G solar 100 mW cm\u22122 simulator illumination (Enlitech Solar Simulator SS-F5-3A) was performed on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in air (60% humidity) at room temperature without encapsulation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a SR830 lock-in amplifier. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. A xenon lamp was used as the light source.\n\nThe AFM images were obtained by the Bruker Dimension Icon in the ScanAsyst mode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by the field-emission SEM (FEI Nova_Nano SEM 430). The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by a Bruker ECO D8 (Bruker, Germany). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained by the spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750).

Cesium iodide (CsI), anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (CB), toluene and isopropanol (IPA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly-(4-butylphenyl diphenylamine) (poly-TPD) was bought from Xi'an Polymer Light Technol. Corp. All chemicals were directly used as received.\n\nIn our proposed method (denoted as the coupled method), the PbI2\u2013(CsI)0.15\u2013(FAI) intermediate complex films were first deposited on preheated poly-TPD/ITO substrates (80 \u00b0C) by spin-coating a hot precursor solution (80 \u00b0C) at 3000 rpm for 40 s, during which 200 \u03bcl toluene was poured onto the substrate. The precursor solution consists of 461 mg PbI2, 39 mg CsI, 79 \u03bcl DMSO, 1 ml DMF and different amounts of FAI. The amount of CsI is set constant, corresponding to an atomic ratio of 15%, whereas the atomic ratio of FAI ranges from 0 to 85% (corresponding to PbI2). The intermediate complex films, except for the case of PbI2\u2013(CsI)0.15\u2013(FAI)0.85, were then annealed at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by the spin-coating of FAI (30 mg ml\u22121 in IPA) at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The resulting perovskite precursor films were finally annealed at 140 \u00b0C for 1 h and washed by spin-coating with 100 \u03bcl IPA. All the above processes were carried out in ambient air with a RH of 70 \u00b1 10%.\nFor comparison, devices were also fabricated by premixing-only, preheating-only and non-intermediate methods. In the case of the premixing-only method, the amount of FAI premixed into the precursor solution in the first step corresponded to an atomic ratio of 30% (relative to PbI2), and all the precursor solutions and substrates were at room temperature without any preheating. All other procedures were the same as the coupled method. In the cases of the latter two, as compared to the coupled method, the only difference lied in the precursor solutions. Specifically, for the non-intermediate method, the precursor in the first step was changed to a hot PbI2 solution (461 mg PbI2 in 1 ml DMF and 79 \u03bcl DMSO, 80 \u00b0C), and the precursor solution in the second step was changed to a hot CsI/FAI IPA solution (12 mg CsI and 45 mg FAI in 1 ml IPA, 80 \u00b0C). As for the preheating-only method, the precursor solution in the first step consisted of 461 mg PbI2, 39 mg CsI, 79 \u03bcl DMSO and 1 ml DMF, while the precursor solution in the second step was a hot FAI solution (45 mg ml\u22121 in IPA).\n\nIndium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were successively washed with decon 90, deionized water and isopropanol and dried in an oven. Prior to device fabrication, the ITO glass substrates were subjected to an ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment for 20 min. After that, a poly-TPD in CB solution, with a concentration of 4 mg ml\u22121, was spin-coated on the ITO at 6000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 120 \u00b0C for 10 min. To tune its surface hydrophilicity, the poly-TPD layer was subjected to a UVO exposure for 20 s. Afterwards, the perovskite layer was deposited onto the modified poly-TPD according to the methods described above. Subsequently, a 20 nm-thick fullerene layer (C60), 8 nm-thick 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline layer (BCP) and Ag electrode (70 nm) were successively deposited atop by thermal evaporation. The active area of the device was 0.1 cm2.\n\nThe morphology of the samples was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30 FEG). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S). As the substrate has a huge impact on the quality of the perovskite film atop, the samples used for UV-vis measurement have the configuration of perovskite/poly-TPD/ITO. Prior to the measurement, two identical poly-TPD/ITO substrates were used for calibration, one of which was then replaced by the samples, and the other was used as the reference. The detector automatically recorded the intensity of the incident light passing through the sample and reference, which were termed as I and Io, respectively, thus acquiring the absorption spectra. The thickness of the perovskite films was determined by using a surface profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150). X-ray diffraction characterization was carried out on a D2 Phaser instrument with Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.154 nm) radiation. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were acquired on a time correlated single photon counting spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments (LifeSpec II), and the samples were excited with a 485 nm laser. The current\u2013voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained on a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm\u22122), and the scan rate was 10 mV s\u22121. The external quantum efficiency and device reflectance measurements were conducted on a home-built set-up. The photo-durability was tested by tracking the current density of a continuously working device (unencapsulated) exposed to one sun illumination in ambient air (RH: 70 \u00b1 10%), and the device was subjected to a voltage bias of 0.76 V, corresponding to its maximum power point. The thermal stability was evaluated by measuring the J\u2013V characteristics of the devices (85 \u00b0C, unencapsulated) every few hours in ambient air (RH: 70 \u00b1 10%).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: C60 | BCP,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Evaporation | Evaporation,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: CsFAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 80.0 >> 140.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 5.0 >> 60.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Poly-TBD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 85.0; 85.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 24,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 15.56,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 95,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) was obtained from Pilkington (14 \u03a9 sq\u22121).

Spiro-OMeTAD was deposited after ETL cooling down, solution containing Spiro-OMeTAD (76.0\u202fmg), 4-tert-butypyridine (28.5\u202f\u03bcL), Li-TFSI (17.5\u202f\u03bcL, 520\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121) and chlorobenzene (1.0\u202fmL), deposited by spin-coating at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. Finally, about 60\u202fnm thick Au counter electrode was deposited via vacuum thermal evaporation at rate of 1.0\u202f\u00c5\u202fs\u22121. The active area of PSCs was confirmed to be 0.09\u202fcm2 by a non-reflective metal mask. All processes including fabrication, measurement and storage of devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/SnO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were carried out under ambient conditions.\n\nFor analyzing crystal structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Panalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 10\u00b0 min\u22121 with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.5406\u202f\u00c5). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer, PHI 5400 ESCA system) analysis was used to calibrate binding energy value. For the observation of morphologies of nanoparticles and films, New Generation Cold Field Emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU8000) and atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruber, Dimension Icon) have been used. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were conducted on V2.7 fluorescence spectrometer from HORIBA. UV\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) absorption spectroscopy surveys were performed on TU1901 spectrometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, AXIS NOVA, Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) using He I (21.2\u202feV) as the photon source was employed to measure the work function. Photocurrent density-photovoltage (J-V) curves and open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) of PSCs were measured with an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 3, Ametek, USA) and a class ABB solar simulator (model 94021A, Newport, USA) under AM 1.5G sunlight (100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122) illuminated with a sweep rate of 0.2\u202fV\u202fs\u22121.

Unless otherwise indicated, all materials were obtained from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The PTAA (0.5\u202fmg/mL) and NPB (2.5\u202fmg/mL) were dissolved in chlorobenzene, and then mixed using desired ratios for NPB/PTAA ranging from 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 to 3.0\u202fwt%. Low NPB/PTAA doping ratios were obtained by diluting the high doping solution, and all mixed solutions were stirred and heated at 70\u202f\u00b0C overnight. The perovskite precursor solution contained 645\u202fmg of PbI2 and 222\u202fmg of CH3NH3I in a 1\u202fmL of mixed solvent of DMSO and DMF (VDMSO/VDMF\u202f=\u202f1:4). In addition, 20\u202fmg of PC61BM was dissolved in 1\u202fmL of chlorobenzene. All solutions mentioned above were stirred at 60\u202f\u00b0C overnight and filtered with 0.45\u202f\u03bcm nylon filters before device fabrication.\n\nDevices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ag. ITO (15\u202f\u03a9/sq) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol under sonication for 20\u202fmin at 40\u202f\u00b0C. After drying, the substrates were further treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 15\u202fmin. HTLs with different NPB doping ratios were fabricated by spin-coating at 4000\u202frpm and 3000\u202frpm for 35\u202fs, followed annealing at 110\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. For the reference devices, the substrates with pristine PTAA were transferred out of the glovebox for a 10\u202fs of oxygen plasma treatment and then transferred back into the glovebox for device fabrication. Note that because the bare PTAA film was so smooth and non-wetting towards DMF and DMSO, the precursor solution hardly coated the substrate, making it difficult to fabricate good quality of perovskite film with large grain size and less grain boundary on the top of it. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers were then deposited using a one-step chlorobenzene-assisted solution process. The perovskite solution was added on top of the HTL and spin-coated at 6000\u202frpm for 20\u202fs. Then, 60\u202f\u03bcL of chlorobenzene was added dropwise at 6\u202fs to form a transparent perovskite film. After 10\u202fmin of annealing at 100\u202f\u00b0C on a hot plate, the perovskite film was obtained. After depositing the perovskite layer, a PC61BM electron transport layer was then deposited by spin coating at 2000\u202frpm for 40\u202fs, followed by annealing at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. Finally, the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber for evaporation of the silver electrodes, silver electrodes were finally deposited onto PC61BM under high vacuum through a shadow mask, defining a device area of 6.25\u202fmm2.\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Panalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray Powder Diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f0.154\u202fnm). The absorption spectra for the perovskite films were measured with a Varian 5E UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with field-emission electrons using a Nova 230 Nano SEM to obtain both top-view and cross-sectional images of films and devices. The contact angles of modified HTLs were measured using a JC000DI optical contact-measuring system (Zhong Chen. Shang Hai). The energy levels of different modified layers were measured by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS, Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Scientific). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements, including steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra for perovskite films deposited on different HTLs were collected using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 with an excitation wavelength of 480\u202fnm. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode V instrument to evaluate the surface morphology of films in tapping and intelligent modes.\nThe current density-voltage characteristics of devices were measured at each 20\u202fmV voltage step. And the measurement is simulated under Air-Mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight at 100\u202fmW/cm2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U) with a 2400 Series Source Meter (Keithley Instruments).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a system combining a xenon lamp, monochromator, chopper, and lock-in amplifier and calibrated silicon photodetector. Long-term stability measurements were carried out for the best performing cells without encapsulation, the devices were kept in a dry room with controlled humidity (20%\u202f<\u202fRH<50%) and covered with aluminum foil during device storage. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky capacitance analysis was carried out using an Ivium Electrochemical Workstation (Netherlands) under dark conditions.

Substrates were then cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and methanol and finally treated under oxygen plasma for 10 min to remove the organic residues. Nb-doped TiO2 target was prepared by cold pressing a mixture of TiO2 powder (purity: 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and Nb2O5 powder (99.99%, Aladdin) and sintering at 1400 \u2103 for 12 h in air. Nb-doped TiOx electron transport layer was deposited onto FTO/Glass or ITO/PET substrates (temperature 70oC) by PLD technique. The distance between the target and the substrate was approximately 55 mm. Prior to deposition, the chamber was evacuated to a pressure of ~4\u00d710-6 mbar. Then, the deposition pressure of the chamber was controlled to be 0.20 mbar by pure O2 flow. The film thickness can be monitored by the film-thickness meter (RHEED) which was mounted on the substrate stage in the chamber. Then PbI2 powders were used to fabricate PbI2 films via thermal evaporation process (evaporation electric current: 50 A; evaporation voltage: ~220 V; Chamber pressure: ~8\u00d710\u2212 4 Pa). The PbI2 film thickness, which is detected by the film-thickness meter in the chamber, can be controlled by the evaporation time. Immersing the FTO/TiO2/PbI2 film in a solution of MAI in isopropanol (15 mg/mL) allows the formation of MAPbI3 through the reaction of PbI2 and MAI. The color of the film changed immediately from red-brown to dark brown, indicating the production of MAPbI3. When the reaction (40 min for full transformation) was finished, the devices were transferred into pure isopropanol solution to rinse off excess MAI and then kept 5 min at 50\u201370 \u2103 on hot plate for drying. After that, ZnPc hole modified layer was prepared on FTO/Nb-TiOX/MAPbI3 substrate by rotary vacuum thermal evaporation (320 \u2103, 8\u00d710\u22124 Pa). Then another hole conductor was deposited on the FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 or FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/ZnPc substrate by spin coating spiro-OMeTAD at 1500 rpm for 30 s in nitrogen atmosphere and left in a closed dry box for 25 min. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 100 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 45 \u00b5L of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 10 mg/m LiN(CF3SO2)2 N to 2 mL of chlorobenzene then stirred for 1 h. In order to ensure the consistency of the experimental process, the single Spiro-OMeTAD based devices in a mask was also placed in the chamber when the ZnPc based cells was put in the vacuum chamber to evaporate the compound (Dye content 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 320 \u00baC. Finally, Au electrode with a thickness 100 nm was deposited on the top of HTM via thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber (9\u00d710\u22124 Pa). An evaporation mask was used to define the areas of the devices, and the active area of each device was controlled to be 2\u00d75, 5\u00d75, 10\u00d710 and 15\u00d715 mm2.\n\nNon-masked devices were tested under a Class A solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000) at AM1.5 and 100 m/cm2 illumination conditions calibrated with a reference Silicon cell (RERA Solutions RR-1002), using a Keithley 2400 as a source-meter in ambient condition for J-V measurements with 60 points from +1.5 V to \u22121.5 V. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded by using SolarCellScan100. The surface morphology of the films and cross-sections were characterized by a SIRION field-emission scanning electron microscope. XRD for Nb-TiOx films was carried out on a Rigaku D/max 2550 X-ray di\ufb00ractometer, using a monochromatized Cu target radiation source at a scanning rate of 4o/minute. The EDS spectra were recorded on Nova_NanoSEM430. The local roughness of the thin films was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; 5500, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) operated in contact mode. The Hall Effect experiment was performed using the HL5500 Hall effect measurement system. Firstly, Nb doped TiOx films was deposited on the quartz glass substrate and formed a square (1 cm\u00d71 cm) by the mask. The thickness of the Nb doped TiOx film was about 500 nm. Then, the In-Sn alloy was placed on the four corners of the square as the electrode. The Hall measurement revealed mobility of 0.02, 1.02 and 1.30 cm2 /(V s) for TiOx, 5% Nb doped TiOx and 10% Nb doped TiOx films. The absorption spectrum was recorded with UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (UV-1600). Water contact angles were measured by Dataphysics OCA20 contact angle measuring system in ambient air at room temperature for ZnPc/MAPbI3/FTO and spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI3/FTO samples.

PbI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Alfar Aesar. CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized in our lab according to a reported procedure. PCBM and Chlorobenzene (CB) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich.\n\nIn-situ graphene was synthesized at low temperatures via PATCVD with dc sputtering for Ti (10\u202fnm)-buffer layer deposition. The Ti 10\u202fnm buffer layer was deposited onto a cleaned PES substrate at 150\u202f\u00b0C via dc sputtering (DC power, 25\u202fW; working pressure, 0.7\u202fPa; gas flow rate of Ar/H2, 10/10 sccm (standard cc min\u22121); deposition time, 10\u202fmin; distance between target and substrate (T-S), 12\u202fcm). After deposition of a Ti buffer layer, in-situ graphene was deposited onto the Ti buffer layer at 150\u202f\u00b0C via PATCVD under optimal conditions (RF power, 70\u202fW; working pressure, 2.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f102\u202fPa; gas-flow rate of Ar/CH4/H2, 12/10/3 sccm; deposition time, 1.5\u202fh; distance between plasma gun and substrate, 10\u202fcm; distance between plasma guns, 10\u202fcm) (See Fig. S1). The transfer graphene as a reference sample was prepared on copper foil via a CVD-growth process at 950\u202f\u00b0C. PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) was spin-coated onto the graphene/copper foil and baked at 180\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin. The copper foil was then etched using an aqueous solution of FeCl3 at 40\u202f\u00b0C. Finally, the PMMA/graphene was transferred onto the cleaned PES. The substrate was submerged in an acetone solution to remove the PMMA. The samples were then dried in a nitrogen glove box.\n\nFlexible PSC devices with a planar structure consisting of AAA/PCBM/MAPbI3/NiOx/Graphene/PES substrate were fabricated to investigate the influence of perovskite thickness on device performance. First, a conductive area was covered by a tape at the edge of the Graphene/PES substrate (graphene sheet resistance: ~81\u202f\u03a9/\u25a1) to allow a measurement connection. Next, an electron-blocking layer (NiOx) with a thickness of 10\u202fnm was deposited via facing target sputtering (FTS) onto the graphene electrode that served as a hole transport layer. The FTS was designed to prevent the plasma-damage of the graphene for deposition of NiOx blocking layer onto the graphene film. The FTS technique was previously described [] for an ultrathin, compact NiOx blocking layer whereby two NiO targets (99.99%) were placed in opposition at a distance of 9\u202fcm with plasma filling the space between the surfaces of the targets, and an RF power of 100\u202fW was applied from a gun that created an Ar:O2 gas-flow rate of 10:1 sccm with the working pressure maintained at 0.2\u202fPa. The substrate holder was heated using a halogen lamp at 100\u202f\u00b0C placed in a horizontal direction far from the targets at equal distances of 9\u202fcm. A 10\u202fnm thickness of NiOx was obtained after an appropriate deposition time of 9\u202fmin.\nA smooth and dense perovskite (MAPbI3) films with a thickness of ~300\u202fnm were synthesized using a one-step process via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The schematics of CVD are mentioned in our previous work [], whereby a 2-inch quartz tube furnace (KJMTI OTF1200X) was used with two separate temperature zones. For the present study, the perovskite materials were simultaneously fabricated through dual-source evaporation from PbI2 and MAI (Sigma Aldrich) using argon as a carrier gas. Then, 300\u202fmg of MAI and 150\u202fmg of PbI2 were placed in the upper-flow right zone (zone 1) to confine the vapor. According to the differences in the melting-point temperatures of the PbI2 and MAI powder, the positions of these sources were located at the center and 10\u202fcm to the right side of zone 1, respectively. The bl-NiOx/Graphene substrates were placed in the down-flow on the left side of zone 2 and set at a temperature of 100\u202f\u00b0C. The furnace was then sealed and pumped down to a pressure of 1.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f102\u202fPa under the control of Ar gas flow at 100 sccm. The perovskite layers were optimized for high crystallinity without PbI2 or MAI phases by varying different key parameters such as the gas flow rate, temperature, time, and the amounts of two different sources. After fabrication of the perovskite layer, an in-situ annealing process was performed in the second zone of the furnace immediately after deposition at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin.\nFor the electron transport layer, a 40\u202f\u03bcl solution of PCBM dissolved in chlorobenzene (25\u202fmg/ml) was spin-coated onto MAPbI3/bl-NiOx/graphene/PES substrates at 4000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs, then dried at 80\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin to allow the PCBM to crystallize and diffuse into the perovskite layer. Finally, devices were completed with the deposition of an AAA top electrode via FTS []. The AZO targets (3% Al doping) were used with target-to-target and target-to-substrate distances of 9 and 10\u202fcm, respectively. Initially, the sputtering chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 1.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fPa using a turbo molecular pump. RF power of 100\u202fW was used for each gun for an Ar flow rate of 10 sccm and a working pressure that was maintained at 0.4\u202fPa. The Ag layer was deposited at a pressure of 0.4\u202fPa with dc power of 6.5\u202fW.\n\nOptical transmittance values for the PES/graphene and full device were measured using S-3100 UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. The resistivity, Hall mobility, and carrier density were measured using a Z-theta method within a range of from 100\u202fHz to 10\u202fMHz with an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (HP4194A) that also was used to measure the Hall effect of the van der Pauw geometry (HL-5500PC, Accent). The surface morphologies of the perovskite dye and the cross-sectional images of the solar cell devices were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TOPCON DS-130C). The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of MAPbI3 and PCBM/MAPbI3 were measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The UPS ((ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra for determination of work-function of the graphene electrodes were measured using an Axis-Nova (Kratos) with a He discharge lamp. Photocurrent-voltage (I\u2013V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using an IVIUMSTAT under illumination from a Sun 3000 solar simulator composed of 1000\u202fW mercury-based Xe arc lamps and AM 1.5-G filters. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs were measured in air conditions by a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100 system equipped with a 100\u202fmW Xenon lamp. Light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode. The bending test was performed within a calculated strain percentage. In these tests, a sample size of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fcm2 was fixed in a bent stage using gas vents with a setup delay time of 1\u202fs for each cycle. The current-voltage J-V curves of the solar devices were measured after the bending test at the same time and under the same conditions.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: PES | Ti | Graphene,\n ETL_stack_sequence: NiO-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Sputtering,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: none,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: CVD,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: AZO | Ag | AZO,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Sputtering | Sputtering | Sputtering,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25.0; 25.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 500,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 11.7,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 80,\n Cell_area_measured: 1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: TRUE,\n Cell_semitransparent: TRUE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The NiOX powder was prepared according to the published literature [].

The NiOX NCs ink (20\u202fmg/mL in DI water) was spin-coated onto the clean surface of the ITO substrates at 2000\u202frpm for 60\u202fs in air to obtain approximately 40\u202fnm NiOX film. The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox from a 1.1M:1.1M ratio of PbI2:MAI in a mixture solution of DMF, \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a volume ratio of DMF/DMSO/GBL of 5:2.5:2.5, The spin-coating procedure was performed at 1500\u202frpm for 15\u202fs, followed by 3000\u202frpm for 35\u202fs. At 5\u202fs before the end of the spin-coating, a C60 solution (2\u202fmg/mL) from toluene was pipetted onto the substrate. Perovskite precursor-coated substrate was annealed first at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fmin and then at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin to form the perovskite film. Subsequently, the ETL layer of PCBM (20\u202fmg/mL in dichlorobenzene) was initially spin-coated on perovskite film at the rate of 1000\u202frpm for 60\u202fs and then at 4000\u202frpm for 60\u202fs. A ZrAcac (2\u202fmg/mL in absolute alcohol) buffer layer was then deposited by spin coating at 4000\u202frpm for 40\u202fs. Finally, the samples were moved to a thermal evaporator for Au (approximately 100\u202fnm) deposition. The active area of the device is 0.04\u202fcm2. The thickness of the perovskite is approximately 350\u202fnm and that of PCBM is approximately 30\u202fnm. Meanwhile, the thicknesses are approximately 4\u202fnm for ZrAcac. Encapsulation: In the glove box filled with nitrogen, the device is covered with a glass sheet at the back and then sealed with a Torr Seal epoxy.\n\nThe J\u2013V characteristics were measured using a Keithley2635B source meter. Illumination was provided by an Abet 2000 solar simulator with AM1.5G spectra at 100\u202fmW/cm2. Film thickness was checked with an Ambios XP-2 profilometer. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) data were recorded using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100 with a calibrated silicon reference cell, and these measurements were converted to EQE. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of active layers were acquired by a Shimadzu UV-3101\u202fPC spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were performed using a Hitachi. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were performed on a D/max 2200 v X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.540\u202f\u00c5). The morphology and phase images of active layers were performed by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode with the scan size of 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u03bcm [] or 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f\u03bcm [] by SPI3800/SPA400. The measured ionization potentials (photoelectron emission spectrum) were measured by AC-2. TRPL and PL spectra were calculated by Delta flex and Nanolog FL3-2Ihr, respectively. XPS was tested through Axis Ultra. The light source for the stability test is a LED lamp (color temperature 5000\u202f\u00b0C), which has stable light intensity equivalent to one sun illumination. We use the Source-Meter Keithley 2635 to measure the J\u2013V characteristics of the PSCs.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60 | Zr(acac)4,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: C60,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO; GBL,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 70; 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 3.0; 7.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: NiO-np,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25.0; 25.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1000,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 70,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.04,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The inverted MAPbI3 PSCs with p-i-n type junction were fabricated based on the structure of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/PCBM/Bphen/Cu.

FTO glasses with sheet resistance of 15\u202f\u03a9\u202f\u25a1\u22121 were purchased from Nippon Glass Corp (Japan) and used as substrates for preparing PSCs.\n\nNiO NCs were synthesized by a solvothermal method. Firstly, a solution containing 0.257\u202fg nickel (II) acetylacetonate, 6\u202fmL OAm and 10\u202fmL toluene was prepared. Secondly, the solution was poured into a 50\u202fmL autoclave and heated at 180\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. After natural cooling to room temperature, the solution was poured out and mixed with 20\u202fmL ethanol to precipitate NiO NCs.

Before preparing inverted planar PSCs, these FTOs were treated with UV-ozone for 30\u202fmin. The as-prepared NiO NCs dispersed in toluene (10\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121) was used for preparing NiO HTLs on the patterned FTOs by spin-coating the dispersion at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, soon afterwards heated at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin.

To evaluate the recombination process in perovskite solar cells, light intensity dependent J\u2013V characteristics were studied at a scan rate of 200 mV s\u22121 under the illumination with various light intensities ranging from 100 mW cm\u22122 to 1.4 mW cm\u22122. In order to identify the mobile ion concentration in the perovskite film, transient ionic current was employed. An external forward bias (at the Voc point) was applied to the devices for 1 minute without illumination, followed by releasing the voltage to 0 V and recording the current as a function of time for another 60 s. All the measurements were performed under dark conditions. For the stability measurements, all the devices were stored inside a dry box with humidity around 40\u201350% under ambient light. And the devices were taken out to complete the J\u2013V characteristics at set intervals. The shelf-life of perovskite solar cells studied in this work was defined as the time when the efficiencies dropped to 70% of the initial value. For the photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements, perovskite films with different MAI loading times were deposited on quartz substrates. Monochromatic light chopped at 13 Hz as the pump beam was applied to shine onto the samples. Meanwhile, a probe laser was placed on the perpendicular side and a position sensitive sensor connected with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, Model SR830) is placed on the opposite side to detect the deflection signals. For the transient photocurrent measurements, the devices were connected to a 50 \u03a9 input terminal.

To specify the illuminated area, we used an aperture with an area of 0.06 cm2, whereas the total device area defined by the overlap of the electrodes was approximately 0.12 cm2.\nThe J\u2013V characteristics were measured with Keithley 2400 measurement source units with the devices maintained at room temperature in glove-box. The photovoltaic response was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Enli Technology) at 100 mW cm\u22122, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic reference cell. The devices were stored in glove-box in dark overnight before measurement. The forward J\u2013V scans were measured from \u22120.1 V to 1.2 V with a scan rate of 0.05 V s\u22121 and a voltage step of 0.01 V while the reverse J\u2013V scans were measured from 1.2 V to \u22120.1 V with a scan rate of 0.05 V s\u22121 and a voltage step of 0.01 V.

The vertical ion plating system (5 generation) consisted of the tray loader, load lock chamber, process chamber, and return chamber. Two sets of electron guns were vertically oriented inside the process chamber (Fig. S1\u2020). Unlike a typical plasma arc ion plating system, where the plasma beam irradiated on the tablet is located at the bottom of a vacuum chamber, the plasma beam in the in-line arc plasma ion plating system is irradiated from the side to the vertically located ITO tablet (10 wt% Sn-doped In2O3), which directly faces the PET substrate as shown in Fig. 1(a). Using an ITO tablet revolver system (Fig. S1(d)\u2020), the ITO tablet was supplied in the process chamber without breaking vacuum for continuous coating. The much higher electron density of the arc-discharge plasma compared to the electron density in the sputtering process led to the formation of a high-density plasma beam for sublimation of the ITO tablet. The 10 wt% Sn-doped In2O3 tablet was used to deposit ITO films under a base pressure of less than 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 Torr. We employed same composition ITO tablet with typical ITO target used in sputtering process. The PET substrate attached on the in-line tray was supplied to the process chamber through the load-lock chamber. Then, flexible ITO films were deposited on the PET substrates at a constant direct current (DC) power of 3 kW, an Ar/O2 flow rate of 300/90 sccm and a working pressure of 3 mTorr, in increasing processing cycles to handle the thickness of the ITO films. In the vertical ion plating system, the PET substrates could be moved repeatedly between the process chamber and return chamber to control the films thickness.\n\nThe electrical and optical properties of the ion-plated ITO films were investigated using the Hall effect measurement (HL5500PC, Accent Optical Technology, HL5500PC) and a UV/Visible spectrometer (UV 540, Unicam) as a function of ITO film thickness. The surface morphology and structure of ion-plated ITO and sputtered ITO films were compared using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Carl Zeiss, MERLIN), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) and atomic force microscope (AFM, SII, SPA-300HV). In addition, the work function of the ion-plated ITO and sputtered ITO films were compared using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo, ESCALAB250). The mechanical flexibility of ion-plated and sputtered ITO films was examined using a lab-made inner and outer bending test system as a function of the radius and bending cycles. The change in resistance of the ion-plated and sputtered ITO films can be expressed as \u0394R = (R \u2212 R0)/R0, where R0 is the initial measured resistance, and R is the resistance measured under ITO bending.\n\nTo fabricate the flexible ITO-based planar type MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells, we cleaned the flexible ITO substrate by ultrasonication in 5% Helmanex soap in de-ionized water, ethanol and then isopropyl alcohol. After solvent cleaning, we conducted an Ar plasma treatment on the flexible ITO substrate to remove the organic residues. We prepared ZnO nano-sol as a ZnO electron conductor by a reported method. Briefly, 1.64 g zinc acetate dehydrate (Aldrich) and 0.5 g ethanolamine (Aldrich) were dissolved with vigorous stirring in 10 g 2-methoxyethanol (Aldrich) at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. To form the ZnO electron conducting layer on the flexible ITO substrate, we fixed the PET/ITO substrate on a glass substrate with double-sided adhesive film for spin-coating process of ZnO nano-sol and spin-coated the ZnO nano-sol solution at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds and then dried it at 150 \u00b0C for 10 min. We prepared the 40 wt% of MAPbI3 perovskite solution by mixing MAI (DSLogics. Co., Ltd) and PbI2 (Aldrich) (1:1 mole ratio) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich) at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. We then added hydriodic acid to the MAPbI3 perovskite solution. To prepare the MAPbI3 thin film on the ZnO/flexible ITO substrate, we spin-coated the 40 wt% of MAPbI3 perovskite solution with hydriodic acid (40 wt% MAPbI3 in DMF solution/hydriodic acid = 1 mL/100 \u03bcL) at 3000 rpm for 200 seconds and dried it on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C for 2 min. Afterwards, we deposited the poly-triarylamine (PTAA, EM index) hole conductor with additives on the MAPbI3/ZnO/flexible ITO substrate by spin-coating PTAA/toluene (15 mg/1 mL) with 7.5 \u03bcL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Aldrich)/acetonitrile (170 mg/1 mL) and 7.5 \u03bcL tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, Aldrich)/acetonitrile (1 mL/1 mL) additives at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, we deposited an Au counter electrode by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.16 cm2. All device fabrications were conducted below 25% relative humidity.\n\nThe current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were measured using a solar simulator (Peccell, PEC-L01) with a potentiostat (IVIUM, IviumStat) under illumination of 1 sun (100 mW cm\u22122 AM 1.5G), which was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certificated by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). The J\u2013V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of 0.096 cm2. The forward and reverse scan speed of J\u2013V measurement was fixed to 10 mV per 200 ms (50 mV s\u22121). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a power source (ABET 150 W Xenon lamp, 13014) with a monochromator (DONGWOO OPTORN Co., Ltd, MonoRa-500i) and a potentiostat (IVIUM, IviumStat).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: PET | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: ZnO-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: HI,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 2,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PTAA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.096,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: TRUE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Perovskite solar devices were fabricated on FTO-coated glass (Pilkington-TEC15) patterned by laser etching. Before the deposition, the substrates were cleaned using Hellmanex\u00ae solution and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. Thereupon, they were ultrasonicated in 2-propanol and dried by using compressed air. The TiO2 blocking layer was deposited onto the substrates by spray pyrolysis at 450 \u00b0C, using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:14, v/v), with oxygen as the carrier gas. The TiO2 compact layer was then kept at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min for the formation of the anatase phase. Once the samples achieve room temperature, a TiO2 mesoporous layer was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 10 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NR-T) diluted in ethanol (1:5, weight ratio). After drying at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, the TiO2 mesoporous layer was heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min and later cooled to room temperature. An additional doping treatment using Li+ ions (10.04 mg LiTFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile, 35 mM) was used for the TiO2 mesoporous layer prior to CsPbBr3 deposition.\nFor MAPbI3 based devices, a pure methylammonium lead iodide solution was prepared to be deposited by spin coating using a methodology previously reported: the perovskite precursor solution was adjusted to the relative humidity of the environment (42% R.H.) by the Pb/DMSO ratio. The perovskite precursor solution (50 \u03bcL) was spin-coated in a one-step setup at 4000 rpm for 50 s. During this step, DMF is selectively washed with non-polar diethyl ether just before the white solid begins to crystallize in the substrate. For CsPbBr3 based devices a two-step sequential deposition technique was employed. Firstly, a dissolution of PbBr2 in DMF (1 M) was prepared by heating at 75 \u00b0C for 20 min and filtered (pore size 0.45 \u03bcm). This solution was spin-coated (2500 rpm \u2013 30 s) on a TiO2 mesoporous film. During the deposition process, the dissolution was kept at 75 \u00b0C. Afterward, the substrate was dried on a hot plate at 70 \u00b0C for 30 min. Subsequently, the substrates were dipped for 10 min in a solution of 17 mg mL\u22121 CsBr in methanol at 60 \u00b0C. Then, the substrates were annealed at 250 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nFor both the MAPbI3 and CsPbBr3 based devices, Spiro-OMeTAD was deposited as a hole selective material by dissolving 72.3 mg in 1 mL of chlorobenzene as well as 17.5 \u03bcL of a lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile), and 28.8 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The Spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The solution was filtered with a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE filter prior to its deposition. Finally, 60 nm of gold was deposited as a metallic contact by thermal evaporation under a vacuum level between 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 torr. All the deposition processes were carried out outside a glovebox under environmental conditions.\n\nCurrent\u2013voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained using a solar simulator (ABET-Sun2000) under 100 mW cm\u22122 illumination with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was recorded using a reference mono-crystalline silicon solar cell with temperature output (ORIEL, 91150). A metal mask was used to define an active area of 0.16 cm2. The current\u2013voltage characteristics were determined by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the photocurrent using an Autolab/PGSTAT302N potentiostat. The current\u2013voltage characteristics were measured with a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121 and a sweep delay of 20 s. Incident Photon-to-current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE or EQE) was measured using an Oriel Xenon lamp coupled to a McPherson monochromator. Light intensity was determined as a function of the wavelength using a calibrated silicon photodiode (PH-100 Si, GENTECE).\nThe illumination for the IS measurements was provided by a white LED over a wide range of DC light intensities. Two types of IS experiments were performed: (1) at open circuit (OC) under varying illumination intensities (parameters are extracted, analyzed and plotted as a function of the resulting open-circuit photopotential) and (2) under non open circuit (NOC) conditions with varying DC potential (voltage) while light intensity is fixed. In this latter case the parameters are corrected for voltage drop due to the resulting DC current and the corresponding series resistance. In this work, we will use the labels OC and NOC to refer to these two kinds of experiments. Under both OC and NOC conditions a 20 mV perturbation in the 106 to 10\u22122 Hz range was applied. A response analyzer module (PGSTAT302N/FRA2, Autolab) was utilized to analyze the frequency response of the devices.\nIMPS measurements were carried out by coupling the PGSTAT302N/FRA2 module to the LED. IMPS measurements were performed at short-circuit with a light perturbation corresponding to 10% of the DC background illumination intensity. Due to limitations of the experimental set-up, the measurement was limited to the 105 to 10\u22121Hz frequency range. The NOVA 1.7 software was used to generate data. Z-view equivalent circuit modelling software (Scribner) was used to fit the spectra.\nFor the structural characterization, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of the samples were obtained using a Zeiss GeminiSEM-300 microscope working at 2 keV. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using a Silicon Drift Detector (Oxford Instruments). For optical characterization, UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded by using a Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent) in the range of 400\u2013800 nm. Steady state photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Hitachi, F-7000 Fluorescence spectrophotometer. Temperature-dependent experiments were carried out by means of a MHCS622CD Heating and Cooling Vacuum/gas tight Stage configured with a MTDC600 temperature controller (Microptik).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Undoped,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.16,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The CH3NH3PbI3 layers were prepared in a N2-purged glove box using a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution containing 40 wt% of synthesized CH3NH3I powder and PbI2 in \u03b3-butyrolactone:dimethyl sulfoxide (7:3). This solution was spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 layers by two consecutive spin-coating steps at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 90 and 30 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, toluene (1 mL) was introduced dropwise onto the substrate. The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. To investigate the influence of modifying the CH3NH3PbI3 interface with ALD\u2013Al2O3, ultrathin Al2O3 films were deposited either beneath or above the spiro-OMeTAD layer on CH3NH3PbI3. Because of the humidity sensitivity of CH3NH3PbI3, trimethylaluminum (TMA, Al3(CH3)3) and ozone were chosen as the aluminum and oxygen sources, respectively, to deposit Al2O3 layers using the ALD method. High purity nitrogen gas was used as both the carrier and purge gases. In each ALD cycle, TMA was dosed into the reactor for 100 ms, which was then purged for 2 s before and after O3 was dosed into the reactor for 200 ms. In this study, the deposition temperature was 70 \u00b0C, which is lower than the commonly used temperature of 200 \u00b0C. This lower temperature was chosen because of the relatively low thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD and the strong oxidation characteristics of O3. The deposition rate was 0.1 nm per cycle. The crystal structures of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (D/max 2500 PC, Rigaku Corporation, Japan; 2theta/theta, \u03bb = 0.1542 nm) at 40 kV.\n\nUsually, devices are constructed from the bottom (the side from which the light is incident) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass that is coated with a compact layer of n-type TiO2, which acts as the electron selective contact. The perovskite layer is then deposited on the n-type compact layer, followed by the p-type hole-conductor, which ensures the collection of holes selectively at the silver cathode. To investigate the influence of the ALD\u2013Al2O3 interface modification on the performance of the organic\u2013inorganic hybrid solar cells, three different solar cells were fabricated: FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Al2O3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Al2O3/Ag. The 30 nm thick TiO2 layers were deposited using a sol\u2013gel method with titanium isopropoxide.

After surface treatment of the flexible substrates, 100\u00a0nm-thick ITO films were sputtered onto each substrate using rectangular ITO target at a constant direct current (DC) power of 550\u00a0W, a working pressure of 1 mTorr, an Ar/O2 flow ratio of 30/1 sccm, and a rolling speed of 1.05\u00a0cm/s.\nFig.\u00a01 (a) schematically illustrates the RTR sputtering process for fabricating an ITO film on a 150\u00a0mm-wide CPI or PET substrate at room temperature. After RTR sputtering, the ITO films on the CPI substrate were subjected to rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 300\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min to improve the electrical and optical properties of the ITO. Fig.\u00a01(b) show the picture of the highly flexible and transparent ITO/CPI substrate after RTA process.\n\nThe electrical and optical properties of the RTR-sputtered ITO/CPI and ITO/PET samples were examined using Hall measurements (HL5500PC) and UV/visible spectrometry (UV 540). The mechanical properties of the ITO/CPI and ITO/PET samples were evaluated using a specially designed inner and outer bending system. The outer bending test induced tensile stresses on the film, whereas the inner bending test induced compressive stresses. The change in resistance of the ITO films due to substrate bending can be expressed as \u0394R (=R\u00a0\u2212\u00a0R0)/R0, where R0 is the initial measured resistance, and R is the resistance measured under substrate bending. The following equation was used to calculate the peak strain for a curved ITO film with decreasing bending radius : Strain=dITO+dSub2R\u00d7100 where, d ITO and d Sub are the thicknesses of the ITO and the flexible substrate, respectively. In addition, dynamic fatigue bending was performed using a cyclic bending test machine designed in house and operated at the frequency of 0.5\u00a0Hz for 10,000 cycles.\n\nThe ITO/PET and ITO/CPI substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in 5% Helmanex soap in de-ionized water, ethanol, and then isopropyl alcohol. After solvent cleaning, the substrates were treated with an Ar plasma (150\u00a0W) to remove the organic residues. The ZnO nano-sol used to fabricated ZnO electron conductor, was prepared by a reported method . Briefly, 1.64\u00a0g zinc acetate dehydrate (Aldrich) and 0.5\u00a0g ethanolamine (Aldrich) were dissolved in 10\u00a0g 2-methoxyethanol (Aldrich) under vigorous stirring at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The ZnO nano-sol solution was then spin-coated onto cleaned ITO/PET and CPI substrates at 2000\u00a0rpm for 60\u00a0s and then dried at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. A 40\u00a0wt % solution of MAPbI3 perovskite was prepared by mixing MAI (DS Logics. Co., Ltd.) and PbI2 (Aldrich) in a 1:1\u00a0M ratio in a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, and hydriodic acid was added to the MAPbI3 perovskite solution. The 40\u00a0wt % of MAPbI3 perovskite solution with hydriodic acid (40\u00a0wt% MAPbI3 in DMF solution/hydriodic acid\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mL/100\u00a0\u03bcL) was then spin coated onto the ZnO/ITO/PET or CPI substrates at 3000\u00a0rpm for 200\u00a0s and then dried on a hot plate at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min. Afterwards, a poly-triarylamine (PTAA, EM index Co., Ltd.) hole conductor with additives was deposited on the MAPbI3/ZnO/ITO/PET and CPI substrates by spin-coating a mixture of PTAA/toluene (15\u00a0mg/1\u00a0mL) with 7.5\u00a0\u03bcL Li-bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, Aldrich)/acetonitrile (170\u00a0mg/1\u00a0mL) and 7.5\u00a0\u03bcL tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, Aldrich)/Acetonitrile (1\u00a0mL/1\u00a0mL) additives at 3000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s. Finally, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.16\u00a0cm2. All device fabrications were conducted under relative humidity conditions below 25%.\n\nCurrent density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured using a solar simulator (Peccell, PEC-L01) equipped with a potentiostat (IVIUM, IviumStat), under 1 sun equivalent illumination (100\u00a0mW/cm2 AM 1.5G), calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by Japanese Industrial Standards. The J-V curve for each device was acquired by masking the active area with a metal mask of 0.096\u00a0cm2.

Two of them were deposited by reactive DC/RF magnetron sputtering techniques from an Ni target (50\u202fmm in diameter and 3\u202fmm in thickness) and the other was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering from an NiO target (atomic ratio: 1:1, 50\u202fmm in diameter and 3\u202fmm in thickness, binding with 3\u202fmm-thickness copper backplane). Both of the Ni target and NiO target were of high purity (99.99%). Prior to the sputtering of each film, the base pressure in the chamber was pumped down to less than 1E-6\u202fTorr. The target was pre-sputtered for 15\u202fmin to remove the contamination layer if any on the surface of the target. Over all these three sputtering operations, pure oxygen was introduced as the sputtering gas. The total sputtering pressure and power were constantly kept at 1E-2\u202fTorr and 100\u202fW, respectively (see Table 1 ). The distance between the target and substrates was approximately 8\u202fcm.

The SnO2 layer was deposited on the FTO substrates as reported previously. Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process was done with an equipment of Ensure Scientific Group AutoALD-PE V2.0 equipped with a plasma generator. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-tin(IV) (99%, TDMA-Sn, Strem Chemicals Inc.) was used as the Sn precursor. Oxygen and Argon are used as oxidizer and carrier gases, respectively. The temperature of the reaction is fixed at 100 \u00b0C during the deposition process.\n\nLead iodide (PbI2, Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol), formamidinium iodide (FAI, Dyesol), lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) are purchased and used without further purification. The perovskite precursor was prepared using a Lewis acid-base adduct approach with the mixture of MAI, FAI, PbI2, and DMSO in DMF, where the molar ratio of DMSO and PbI2 is 1:1 . A 45% by weight precursor solution of MAPbI3 was prepared with PbI2, MAI and DMSO (molar ratio=1:1:1) in DMF. The solution was stirred for 12 h on a 60 \u00b0C hot plate before deposition. The FAPbI3 precursor solution was made in the same process. The MA1\u2212xFAxPbI3 precursor was prepared by mixing two different solutions together with different volume ratio, where the ratio of MAI and FAI is changed from 1:0 to 0:1 (x=0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0). The resulting mixed precursor solution was stirred for one hour on a 60 \u00b0C hotplate and then purified using a 0.45 \u00b5m filter before spin-coating.\nThe precursors with Pb(SCN)2 additives are prepared with fixed amounts of Pb(SCN)2 with respect to the weight of PbI2, where the content of Pb(SCN)2 ranging from 0% to 5%.\n\nC60-SAM was deposited on PEALD SnO2 as previously reported . The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the ESL first at 500 rpm for 3 s, and then at 4000 rpm for 60 s using a fast deposition-crystallization technique with diethyl ether as the anti-solvent agent. After spin coating, the perovskite film was annealed at 65 \u00b0C for 2 min and then 100 \u00b0C for 5 min.

For light intensity dependence test, the light intensity was later adjusted between 1 and 100 mW/cm2 using neutral density filters. EQE measurement was carried out with an EQE system (PV Measurements Inc,) using 100 Hz chopped monochromatic light ranging from 300 nm to 900 nm under otherwise near-dark test conditions. The top-view and cross section structures of perovskite films and PVSCs were characterized with a field emission SEM instrument (Hitachi S-4800). Crystallinity and the crystal structure of the perovskite layer were analyzed with an Ultima III X-ray Diffractometer using a Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 x-ray source (Rigaku Corp.). Absorbance spectra were obtained with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 1050). Sheet resistance was measured using four-point probe method resistivity test system (PRO4-440N, Lucas labs). For steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements, perovskite films were fabricated by spin-coating perovskite precursors on glass substrates followed by coating another encapsulating layer of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) after thermal annealing. PL measurements were performed in ambient air at room temperature. Samples were illuminated through the film side. A 532 nm continuous-wave laser (beam diameter \u224890 \u00b5m) at 40 mW/cm2 was used as an excitation wavelength for steady-state PL measurement. PL signal was detected via Symphony-II CCD (from Horiba) detector after a 300 g mm\u22121 grating monochromator (Integration time =0.5 s). For TRPL measurements, samples were excited by a 532 nm pulsed laser (pulse width =5 ps, beam diameter \u2248150 \u00b5m) at 1010 photons pulse\u22121 cm\u22122. TRPL measurements were performed with time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module (Becker & Hickel Simple Tau SPCM 130-E/M module) and the radiative recombination events were detected (Integration time =600 s) via hybrid APD/PMT module (R10467U-50). PL decays of perovskite films with x=0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 are single exponential while bi-exponential PL decays are observed in case of x=0, 0.2 and 1.0. In case of bi-exponential PL decay, the photoluminescence intensity contribution of each component is proportional to the product of amplitude (Ai) and lifetime (\u03c4i). Therefore, the intensity average lifetime of bi-exponential PL decay is calculated as Meanlifetime(\u03c4)=A1\u03c412+A2\u03c422A1\u03c41+A2\u03c42\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: SnO2-c | C60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: ALD | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: FA0.3MA0.7PbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: FAMAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Pb(SCN)2,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 65; 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 2.0; 5.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.08,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Chemicals: Cesium Bromide (CsBr, TCI), lead iodide (PbI2, TCI), poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), chlorobenzene (99.99%, TCI), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), SnO2 nanoparticles (15% dispersed in water, Alfa Aesar), Tin (\u2161) chloride (SnCl2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-aminothiazole (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), imidazolium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), hydriodic acid (HI, 57% in H2O).\nSynthesis of 2-Aminothiazolium Iodide salts (ATI): 2-aminothiazole (10\u202fmmol, 1\u202fg) was dissolved in small amount of ethanol and stirred in an ice bath.

The HTM solutions were spin-coated onto the glass at 2000 rpm for 45 s. Both of the HTM layers were measured as ca. 90 nm with a DekTak profilometer. To measure HTM film stability, control samples were left in air at ambient temperature. A second set of films were heated to 80 \u00b0C for 30 min and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature for 30 min; this sequence made once heating cycle. After each cycle, the films were analysed by UV-visible spectrometry (Varian Cary 5000) and digital imaging using a Canon EOS 1100D camera (F-stop 29, exposure time 0.3 s, ISO 100) in a Photosimile 200 lightbox.

The amount of DMSO was adjusted to have a small excess molar amount over PbI2. The solution was then filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE syringe filter to remove any aggregated particles and dust. The PbI2\u2013DMSO films were formed by spin-casting of the solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The films were then immediately dipped in anhydrous 2-propanol (IPA, Sigma-Aldrich) with subsequent blowing with compressed air in order to remove excess IPA from the film. The resulting PbI2 films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (MAI, Greatcell Solar Ltd.) mixed with CH3NH3Cl (MACl, Sigma-Aldrich, 25 wt% with respect to MAI) in IPA to convert them to perovskite. The films were rinsed with IPA twice to remove any excess MAI from the surface. The remaining IPA was removed by air blowing, then the perovskite films were placed on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C. For the slot-die coating, a table-top slot-die coater (PMC-200, PEMS, South Korea) was used.

As the next step, SnCl4\u00b75H2O in IPA was spin-casted at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The subsequent films were annealed at 180 \u00b0C for 1 h. The perovskite layers were deposited on the substrate by the aforementioned MET or heat treatment of PbI2\u2013DMSO. In order to fabricate the perovskite layer by heat treatment, PbI2\u2013DMSO solution (0.6 g ml\u22121) was spin-coated and then annealed at 70 \u00b0C for 30 min.

CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized by the procedure stated previously.\nPrior to fabrication, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 7 \u03a9 sq.\u22121) substrates were carefully patterned and cleaned, as stated in our previous work. A thin compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was deposited on the patterned FTO by spray pyrolysis at 450 \u00b0C by using 0.2 M Ti(IV) bis(ethylacetoacetate)-bis(ethyl acetoacetate)-diisopropoxide 1-butanol solution, followed by annealing in air at 450 \u00b0C for 1 h.

After drying at 125 \u00b0C for 5 min, the TiO2 films were baked at 500 \u00b0C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature. Prior to their use, the films were dried again at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. The thickness of the annealed TiO2 film was around 280 nm, as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4800). The PbI2 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.698 g of PbI2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1.5 mL of DMF at 70 \u00b0C for 12 h under static conditions.

A white LED is used to illuminate the device continuously in the background (BGL) to generate steady-state charge carrier density creating VOC. A weak 532 nm pulsed laser is applied on top of the BGL to create a small number of additional charge carriers (causing an increase in open-circuit voltage, \u0394VOC), which decays in time after the light pulse switches off. The rate of the green laser pulse is set to 6 Hz. TPC is the same as TPV, and the only difference is that the device is connected to the oscilloscope's 50 \u03a9 input channel instead of 1 M\u03a9. Both BGL and pulsed light intensities are controlled by neutral density filters. TPV/TPC signals are recorded with a Picoscope 6424 controlled by a custom-built Python program. The simulation of the TPC/TPV is done by GPVDM software developed by R. C. I. MacKenzie, which models the device parameters by solving the drift-diffusion, carrier continuity, and Poisson's equations. First, the parameters of the model are optimized to reproduce the J\u2013V characteristics of our reference devices with Spiro-OMeTAD. Then, the TPV/TPC are modeled using the same parameters, and only the targeted parameter is allowed to vary when a certain parameter is needed to be swept for a range.

The patterned FTO substrates were cleaned with ultrasonication for 30 min in a mixture (acetone, soapy water and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), 1:1:1) and then washed with deionized water. Afterwards, the glass was dried with a N2 blower. Dense thin films of titanium dioxide as HBL with varied thickness were deposited onto the FTO substrate using a commercial hot-wall flow-type ALD reactor (SUNALETM R series, Picosun, Finland). The deposition involved alternating exposure of TiCl4 and deionized water vapor at process temperature 300 \u00b0C with a precursor carrier and purge gas N2 at pressure 1.6 kPa. The pulse and purge times for the precursors were 0.1 and 4 s, respectively. The rate of deposition of TiO2 on the FTO glass was estimated to be 0.43 \u00c5 per cycle. To fabricate uniform, one-side deposited TiO2 films, we attached the FTO glass tightly to a smooth cover glass, which was previously washed with deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min.

PL transients were recorded with a TCSPC system (Fluotime200, PicoQuant) with excitation at 635 nm from a picosecond pulsed-diode laser (LDH-635, PicoQuant, FWHM \u223c 70 ps); the PL temporal profiles were recorded at 770 nm.\nConductivity measurements. We used an electrochemical analyzer (ALS/CH Instruments 852C, ALS) with a copper lead wire. The experimental setup of the measurements is as follows: two electrodes of the electrochemical analyzer were connected to the samples, one to the FTO part and the other to the compact ALD-TiO2 surface. We measured the resistivity at various positions on the compact ALD-TiO2 surface. Almost 15 positions have been tested for each sample to derive their mean. The distance between the two electrodes was stable for all measurements and for all compact ALD-TiO2 of varied thickness to make the comparison among them more precise.\nNumerical simulations.

These multilayer configurations were prepared by sequential sputtering processes without breaking the vacuum conditions. The sputtering processes were initiated once the chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 torr. ZnO and TiO2 layers were deposited by sputtering 4-in stoichiometric ZnO and TiO2 targets (Applied Science Co.), respectively, at a radio-frequency power of 200 W and a working pressure of 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 torr, which was attained under an Ar atmosphere flowing at 60 sccm. The thicknesses of the bottom oxide layers were fixed at 5 nm, while the thicknesses of the top oxide layers were varied between 10 and 20 nm. The ITO sputtering conditions using a 4-in ITO target with 10 wt% Sn (Applied Science Co.) were identical to those of the oxide layers. Ag was deposited by sputtering a 4-in pure Ag target (Applied Science Co.) at a direct-current power of 50 W and a working pressure of 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 torr under an Ar atmosphere flowing at 45 sccm. Ag(O) was deposited under conditions equivalent to those of Ag sputtering except for the mixed atmosphere of Ar and O2 at a flow rate of 45:4 sccm, which generated a reactive sputtering process. The sputtering system and process conditions are demonstrated in detail elsewhere.\nPSCs were fabricated on PET substrates using different OMO structural configurations: TiO2/Ag/TiO2, TiO2/Ag/ZnO, TiO2/Ag(O)/TiO2, and TiO2/Ag(O)/ZnO. Fabrication was initiated by exposing the OMOs coated on PET substrates to an ultraviolet (UV)-ozone environment for 20 min prior to coating the perovskite precursors on the OMOs. The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.461 g of PbI2 and 0.159 g of CH3NH3I (MAI) in a mixed solution of 71 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 635 \u03bcl of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, MAPbI3 was deposited from the precursor solution by spin coating followed by a thermal treatment. Specifically, during the spin coating at 4500 rpm for 25 s, the precursor solution was mixed with 700 \u03bcl of diethyl ether, which was added dropwise. The spin-coated film was sequentially annealed at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and 100 \u00b0C for 5 min. The HTL was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in a mixture of 1 ml of chlorobenzene, 28.8 \u03bcl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 17.5 \u03bcl of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), which was prepared by dissolving 520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 ml of acetonitrile (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich).

Finally, a top electrode based on Au with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on the HTL by thermal evaporation with a device area of 0.075 cm2. A thin TiO2 layer between the Au rear contact and the Ag TE, as shown in the structural architecture of the PSCs (Fig. 7a), was applied purely to avoid any deterioration in the electrical conductivity due to oxidation of the TE. However, the thickness of the TiO2 layer was selected to be as low as 5 nm to minimize any detrimental increase in the series resistance, due to the insertion of the TiO2 layer.\n\nThe morphologies of the Ag and Ag(O) TEs, which evolved from nanoclusters to agglomerates, and the TiO2 ETLs were investigated by capturing top-view and cross-sectional high-resolution images using ultrahigh-resolution FE-SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., S-5500) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI, Jeonju, Republic of Korea). The distribution of nanoscopic pinholes in the TiO2 ETLs in different OMO structural configurations was determined using AFM (Bruker, Nanoscope V Multimode 8) in the conductive mode at a 600 mV bias. The surface area of pinholes was determined from the FE-SEM images using image processing software (Nikon, NIS-Elements Basic Research). The nominal thicknesses of the metal and oxide layers were determined either using X-ray reflectivity (Philips, X'pert Pro-MRD) at the KBSI in Daegu, Republic of Korea, or surface profiling (Bruker, Dektak XT) measurements at the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS). The dose of oxygen was determined using XPS (Escalab 200 R, VG Scientific) at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The crystallography of TiO2 and ZnO was characterized using XRD (Empyrean, PANalytical) at the KBSI Daegu. The total (specular + diffusive) transmittance and reflectance spectra were determined using UV-visible spectrophotometry (Agilent Technology, Cary 5000) in the visible spectral range of 330\u2013800 nm. The absorbance spectra of the OMO structures were determined by ascertaining the transmittance and reflectance spectra. The sheet resistances of OMOs and ITOs were determined by averaging the measurements from three different samples with dimensions of 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm2 using a four-point probe (Hitachi Chemical Co., MCP-T600). The mechanical bending tests were carried out using a homemade bending test system by tracking the increase in the resistance of OMOs and ITOs as a function of the bending radius of PET substrates coated with OMOs and ITOs. The bending radius was decreased to 4 mm to subject the samples to increased tensile stresses. The structural reliability of the samples against repeated deformation was also determined by measuring the change in resistance as the samples were bent cyclically up to 5000 times. The J\u2013V characteristic of PSCs was measured using a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400 SourceMeter) with a xenon lamp under one-sun conditions and a light intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122. The light source was calibrated using a modulated silicon solar cell that was certified by the Korea Institute of Energy Research (Taejon, Republic of Korea). The delay between each voltage step was fixed at 200 ms.

China) on FTO substrates by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Before sputtering, the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with distilled water, acetone, and ethanol, respectively. The atomic ratio of Ga to Zn in the GZO film is 5:95. Before deposition, the pressure in chamber was adjusted to 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa, high purity (99.999%) Ar gas with 30 sccm was introduced through a mass flow controller. During the deposition, the chamber pressure, RF power, and deposition time were adjusted to be 0.6 Pa, 100 W, and 2 min, respectively.\n\nGZO films were laser-annealed by irradiating the surface of the film with a XeCl (308 nm) excimer laser in air at room temperature. The thickness of the films were measured with a step profiler and found to be approximately 36 nm, a schematic of the excimer laser anneal system is shown in Fig. 1. A laser beam with an energy of 200 mJ was irradiated onto the films after focussing. The repetition rate of the laser pulse is 1 Hz. The energy density can be calculated by dividing the laser energy by the irradiating area. By adjusting the distance between the film and focusing lens, the effective area changes, thus different energy densities of 105, 90, 75, and 60 mJ cm\u22122 were obtained. The pulse count was adjusted to 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively. The samples under different treatment conditions are labelled as ELA (energy density)-(pulse number). The as-prepared GZO films without any treatment (NG) as well as heated to 500 \u00b0C in air (HG), prepared according to pervious report, were employed for comparison. To ensure the reproducibility for the data 6 samples are included in each group.\n\nThe GZO films with different treatments were used as ETLs in PHJ-PSC. One-step method was applied for the fabrication of the perovskite layer. Specifically, PbI2 (477 mg) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, 160 mg) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.64 mL) and N,N-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 0.16 mL) to form the precursor solution. The solution (40 \u03bcL) was spin-coated on the GZO films at 1000 rpm for 3 s, then 4000 rpm for 12 s, chlorobenzene (CB, 0.3 mL) was uniformly dripped onto the rotating substrate in 10 s at 4000 rpm. The formed MAPbI3 films were heated at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. The hole transport layer (solution of Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene with additive according to the previous report ) was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 60 nm of Au electrode was deposited on the hole transport layer via vacuum thermal evaporation. For comparison, ZnO ETLs prepared by magnetron sputtering (HZ) followed by 500 \u00b0C of heat treatment were also used to fabricate PHJ-PSCs employing the same fabrication process.\n\nThe crystal structure of the films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X'pert diffractometer, Holland) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The morphology of the films was determined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Sirion-200, USA) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, CSPM-5500, China). A step profiler (XP-2, AMBIOS Technology Inc., USA) was used to measure the film thickness. The optical transmittance and absorption spectra of the films were determined by UV-visible spectrophotometry (U-3900H, Japan) in the wavelength range 200 to 900 nm. The resistivity was measured by the standard four probe d.c. method using a Keithley 2420 digital source meter.\nThe photocurrent\u2013photovoltage (J\u2013V) curves of the PHJ-PSCs were measured with a Keithley 2420 digital source meter under irradiation of a solar simulator (Newport Oriel 94043A, USA, AM 1.5, 100 mW cm\u22122). The monochromatic incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were determined employing a 300 W Xe lamp light source with monochromatic light in the range 300 to 900 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on a frequency response analyzer (Zahner, Zennium, Germany), the cells were measured under the bias voltages of 0.8 V in the dark, the frequency range was 1 to 106 Hz, and the magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films were obtained using an Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrometer (UK) with an excitation xenon lamp source. The transient absorption spectra (TAS) of the perovskite films were acquired using laser flash photolysis spectrophotometry (LKS80, UK), the energy of the laser device was 150 mJ cm\u22122 and the repetition rate was 5 Hz. The wavelength of the excitation and probe light were 473 and 770 nm, respectively.\n\nSimulations of the ELA process was performed using ANSYS\u00ae software. The irradiation area of the incident light is large than the substrate and the absorbed power transferred from the laser is symmetrically distributed along the axial axis.\nTherefore, the model can be regarded as a heat flux caused by laser irradiation on a two dimensional finite element film along the thickness orientation, building on the basis that the phase transition does not take place. The thickness of the films and glass substrate was set as 36 nm and 360 nm, respectively. The energy of laser beam is viewed as the absorption in the form of heat, which follows a top Gauss distribution, and the relation between the heat flux and energy density can be described as follows:\nwhere Q is the heat flux, R is the light reflection coefficient of films to the laser, E is the energy density and P is the width of single pulse. Herein, R is set as 0.4, P equals 20 ns, and the values used in simulation are given in Table S1.\u2020\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: ZnO-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Magnetron sputtering,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 70,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Formamidinium iodide HC(NH2)2I (FAI) was synthesized by reacting 30 mL hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) with 15 g of formamidinium acetate (99%, Aldrich) at 0 \u00b0C. After stirring for 2 h, a dark yellow precipitate was recovered by evaporating the solvent at 60 \u00b0C using a rotary evaporator. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and then recrystallized from ethanol. The white precipitate was dried under vacuum for 24 h and stored in a glove box filled with Ar. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.\n\nPerovskite solar cells were fabricated in ambient conditions, in which the relative humidity was not controlled. FTO glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 \u03a9 sq\u22121) were cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, and acetone, followed by sonicating with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. Ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) was treated for 15 min prior to use. The precursor solutions for the SnO2 ETL were prepared by dissolving tin(IV) isopropoxide (Alfa Aesar, 10% w/v in isopropanol (IPA), 99%) in IPA, where the solution concentration was varied from 0.05 M to 0.20 M. The precursor solution was spin-coated on FTO glass in a glove box filled with N2 at a spinning rate of 5000 rpm for 20 s, which was dried at 65 \u00b0C on a hotplate for 1 min. The pre-dried SnO2 films were heated further in the furnace at ambient conditions at different temperatures of 100 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0C, 200 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 350 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. To improve the adhesion of SnO2 layers on FTO, bare FTO glasses were treated with UV ozone for 20 min before and after coating the SnO2 precursor solution. After cooling to room temperature, the substrate coated with SnO2 film was exposed to UVO for 20 min prior to coating the perovskite film. For the perovskite composition, we considered efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to SnO2. Better charge extraction was proposed for the mixed cation perovskite rather than pure CH3NH3PbI3. We designed a composition of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 that was prepared for a SnO2-based planar perovskite solar cell. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.1504 g of FAI, 0.4034 g of PbI2, 0.0459 g of PbBr2, and 0.0266 mg of CsBr in DMF based on the ratio of (PbI2 + PbBr):DMSO:(FAI + CsBr) = 1:1:1. The solution concentration was 54 wt%. The completely dissolved solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 film at 4000 rpm for 20 s, in which 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped on the rotating substrate to induce an intermediate for preparation of the adduct. The perovskite films were formed after heating at 145 \u00b0C for 40 min. Spiro-MeOTAD was used as the HTL and formed on top of the perovskite layer. The 20 \u03bcL of spiro-MeOTAD solution, which consisted of 50.6 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 20.16 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and 12.25 \u03bcL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg LiTSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 0.7 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s.

One sun light intensity was adjusted using the NREL-calibrated Si solar cell having a KG-5 filter. The device was covered with a metal aperture with an active area of 0.125 cm2 during the measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.), in which a monochromatic beam was generated from a 75 W xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan). EQE data were collected in the DC mode without light bias. Absorption and transmittance spectra of the SnO2 films were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Agilent 8453). Plane-view and cross-sectional morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM7000F, JEOL). The thicknesses of SnO2 films were measured by SEM. X-ray diffraction (HD-powder XRD-D8 Advance, Bruker) was used to study the crystal structure of the SnO2 films, in which Cu K\u03b1 radiation was used (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) and the scan rate was 5\u00b0 min\u22121. The binding energy and oxidation state were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo UK) with monochromatic Al K\u03b1 generating a 1486.7 eV X-ray source. The electron take-off angle was fixed at 0\u00b0 and the vacuum pressure was below 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 mbar. The binding energy scale was calibrated using the hydrocarbon contamination on the surface based on the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The work function was investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo UK) using the He I (21.22 eV) emission line. Time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) were measured by a Quantaurus-Tau compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, Hamamatsu). The film samples were excited with a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, model M12488-33, peak power of 231 mW and pulse duration of 53 ps, Hamamatsu) pulsed at a repetition frequency of 10 MHz for time-integrated and 2 MHz for time-resolved PL.

The measured Nyquist plots were fitted using Z-View software using an equivalent circuit composed of series resistance (Rs) and two R\u2013C components (resistance and capacitance in parallel) in series. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) was used to study the surface conductivity of the deposited SnO2 films. A commercial atomic force microscopy system (SPA-400, SII, Japan) was employed using Pt/Ir-coated Si tips (CONTPt, Nanoworld, Switzerland) with a typical resonant frequency of 13 kHz and a spring constant of 0.2 N m\u22121. All the images were acquired with a contact force of \u22121.5 nN, and bias voltages of 0.1\u20130.5 V at a scan rate of 1.0 Hz. Negative biases were applied to the substrate, while the tip was grounded.

All chemicals were used as received.\n\nSnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to a previous report. Briefly, 0.242 g SnCl4\u00b75H2O was first dissolved in 50 mL DI water (18 M\u03a9) under stirring for 5 min, which was denoted as solution A. Simultaneously, 0.05 g NaBH4 was dissolved in 20 mL DI water and denoted as solution B. Then solution B was added drop-wise to solution A. The obtained mixture underwent severe stirring at room temperature for about 2 h. During the reaction, the color of the solution turned from grey to white, suggesting the formation of SnO2 nanoparticles. As the reaction finished, the nanoparticles were collected by centrifuging and washed with DI water. The centrifuging and washing processes were repeated 3 times. The collected nanoparticles were diluted to be around 4 mg mL\u22121 in water to complete the preparation of the n-SnO2 colloidal solution. For the TMAH-modified SnO2 (TMAH-SnO2) colloidal solution, various volumes of TMAH solution (TMAH, 10 wt% in water) were added to the obtained n-SnO2 colloidal solution and stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The added TMAH was varied from 0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% to 2% in volume ratio (TMAH solution: n-SnO2 solution).\n\nAn FTO/ITO glass sheet was sequentially cleaned with detergent (Micro-90, 2% in water), acetone, ethanol and DI water for 30 min. Before deposition of SnO2 thin films, the cleaned FTO was treated with ozone plasma for 15 min. The SnO2 thin films were spin-coated onto the FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and the obtained electrodes were annealed at various temperatures (100 \u00b0C, 125 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0C, and 175 \u00b0C) for 30 min. Then the thin films were cooled down to room temperature naturally. Perovskite layers were deposited onto the SnO2-coated FTO directly by spin coating the precursor using the anti-solvent process. The perovskite precursor solution was first prepared by mixing FAI, MAI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in DMF and DMSO (1.25 M with respect to Pb, DMF:DMSO = 4:1). 1% KI doping (K:Pb atom ratio in solution) is achieved by adding KI solution in DMF to the perovskite precursor solution (0.1 M). The stoichiometric composition of the precursor is FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.5Br0.5. Before spin coating, the precursor was filtered with a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter. The perovskite precursor was first spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s, and the spin rate was increased to 3000 rpm for another 30 s. During the second step of spin coating, CB was poured onto the substrate. After spin coating, the electrode was moved to a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C for 60 min, in order to remove the solvent and for the perovskite crystal growth. The spiro-OMeTAD (80 mg mL\u22121 in CB) solution with LTFSI (9.1 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and 4-TBP (28.5 \u03bcL mL\u22121) was then deposited onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick gold electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a rate of 0.1 nm s\u22121. The active area of the device was determined to be 0.09 cm2 using the mask on the top of the substrate during thermal evaporation.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken with a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F) operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The morphologies of the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI). The conductivity of the thin films was studied by using a conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM, Bruker) in TUNA mode. The steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were measured using a 1/4 m monochromator (Cornerstone\u2122 260) equipped with a silicon charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A continuous wave laser (405 nm, 50 mW) was used as the excitation source, and luminescence was detected using the CCD. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi, with the HeI (21.22 eV) emission line employed for excitation. The data were acquired at a bias of \u221210 V. The work function of the measured samples can be calculated from the following equation: h\u03bd = EFermi \u2212 Ecutoff, here, h\u03bd = 21.22 eV and EFermi = 21.08 eV (using Ni as the standard sample for calibration). The J\u2013V measurements were carried out in ambient air with a Keithley-2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm\u22122, Oriel Sol1A Class ABB Solar Simulator). The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell (NREL) equipped with a power meter. The devices are measured in the reverse scan (1.2 V to \u22120.20 V, 0.01 V per step). For hysteresis studies, forward scans (\u22120.2 V to 1.2 V, 0.01 V per step) were also taken. The delay time has been selected from 1 ms to 1000 ms.

IPCE spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial IPCE setup (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD), which was equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, filter wheel, and monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents were measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated against a certified silicon reference diode. The impedance spectroscopy measurement was carried out by a VSP multichannel potentiostatic\u2013galvanostatic system (Biologic, France), under dark conditions by applying a 5 mV voltage perturbation with the frequency ranging between 1 MHz and 0.1 Hz. The Z-View Analyst software was used to model the Nyquist plots obtained from the impedance measurements.\n\nFilm thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer.

Then, 65\u202f\u03bcl of TiO2 precursor was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 2000\u202frpm for 60\u202fs. The precursor-coated FTO was then thermally calcined using a furnace at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin.\nThe MAPbI3 perovskite absorber and spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer were consecutively deposited in a nitrogen-filled glove box (mBRAUN, UNIlab-B) with H2O concentration\u202f<\u202f0.5\u202fppm and oxygen concentration\u202f<\u202f5\u202fppm. A one-step method was used for perovskite deposition. Then, 578\u202fmg of PbI2 and 200\u202fmg of MAI with molar ratio PbI2:MAI\u202f=\u202f1:1 were added to 1\u202fml of DMF and stirred for one day to form an intermediate phase of MAI-PbI2-DMF. Furthermore, 65\u202f\u03bcl of MAI-PbI2-DMF was spin-coated on the TiO2-coated FTO substrate. Next, 200\u202f\u03bcl of anhydrous chlorobenzene, which served as an anti-solvent, was dispensed after spinning MAI-PbI2-DMF for 7\u202fs, and the color of the perovskite film changed from green to brown. Then, the sample was heated at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin on a hot plate to form perovskite crystals. The perovskite-coated samples were then treated by DBD for 0/5/10/20/40/60\u202fs. Before DBD treatment, the sample was removed from the hot plate and naturally cooled for 2\u202fmin.\nFig. 1 shows the schematic of the DBD setup used in this study. It is a surface DBD system. The powered electrode of the DBD was made of a 3\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fcm square copper foil. The ground electrode was a stainless steel mesh with the same dimension as the copper foil. A 1-mm-thick and 4\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fcm quartz plate was placed between the two electrodes. A high-voltage (HV) AC generator (PVM12, Information Unlimited), featured with a compact size, was used to supply a sinusoidal AC wave with frequency of \u223c50\u202fkHz and amplitude of \u223c8.5\u202fkVpp to the copper electrode. The deposition power was \u223c35\u202fW. The samples were placed directly on the metal mesh of DBD device with the perovskite layer facing the plasma. The plasma system was filamentary in nature and the filamentary discharge was generated between the stainless steel mesh and the quartz plate. The reactive species formed in the plasma then diffused toward the treated sample surface located on the other side of the mesh. The effect of inhomogeneity caused by the non-uniform nature of the filamentary discharge on the treated surface was therefore greatly minimized. After DBD treatment, spiro-OMeTAD was immediately spin-coated at 2000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs to preserve the properties of the DBD-treated perovskites. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 80\u202fmg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1\u202fml of chlorobenzene with the addition of 28.8\u202f\u03bcl of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5\u202f\u03bcl of Li-TFSI solution, and the mixture solution was stirred for 15\u202fmin; here, the Li-TFSI solution was prepared by dissolving 520\u202fmg of Li-TFSI in 1\u202fml of acetonitrile. Next, the samples were stored in a moisture-proof cabinet with relative humidity controlled at 15%\u201320% for 24\u202fh for the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD to proceed. Finally, an 85\u202fnm-thick Ag layer was deposited by electron-beam evaporation as the contact electrode for PSCs.\n\nThe optical emission spectra (OES) of plasma generated in DBD were recorded using a spectrometer (Ocean, FLAME-S-XR1-ES) with a Wi-Fi module (Ocean, STS-KIT-Unice). The Wi-Fi module was used to transmit the recorded spectra from the glove box to the computer. The surface morphology of perovskite films was inspected by scanning electron microcopy (Ultrahigh Resolution FE-SEM, NovaTM, NanoSEM 230) and atomic force microscopy (Asylum Research Cypher S). A high-power X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 DISCOVER SSS) was used to examine the crystallinity of the perovskite layers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific, Theta Probe) was used for inspecting the chemical bonding status of the perovskite surfaces with/without DBD treatment. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of PSCs were evaluated using a source-meter (Keithley 2400) under the illumination of a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A) equipped with an AM1.5 filter. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the PSCs under illumination in the short-circuit condition with 10\u202fmV sinusoidal voltage and measurement frequency range of 1\u2013106\u202fHz. In XRD analysis, samples with perovskite films coated on Corning Eagle XG glass substrates were used to avoid the interference of FTO and TiO2. For OES, SEM, and AFM analyses, samples with perovskite films deposited on TiO2-coated FTO substrates were used to preserve the authenticity of the conditions of PSCs.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "For deposition of the pristine MAPbI3 films, precursor solutions were prepared with 1.2\u00a0M PbI2 and 1.2\u00a0M MAI in the DMF/DMSO co-solvent (VDMF/VDMSO\u00a0= 9:1).

First, a conductive area was etched into the edge of an FTO glass (12\u202f\u03a9/\u25a1, Solaronix TCO30-8). After cleaning in deionized water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, a blocking layer (bl-TiO2) with a thickness of 50\u202fnm was deposited via nano-cluster deposition (NCD) onto the etched FTO substrate. The NCD technique for an ultrathin, compact TiO2 blocking layer has been described previously [].\nA smooth and dense perovskite (MAPbI3) film is synthesized using either a one- or a two-step process via CVD. The schematics of the CVD one- and two-step processes are shown in Fig.\u00a0S1 (Supporting Information).\nFor one-step deposition, a 2-inch quartz tube furnace (KJMTI OTF1200X) was used with two separate temperature zones. The perovskite materials were simultaneously fabricated by dual-source evaporation from PbI2 and MAI (Sigma Aldrich) with argon as a carrier gas. Then, 300\u202fmg of MAI and 150\u202fmg of PbI2 were placed in the upper-flow right zone (zone 1) to confine the vapor. According to the differences in the melting-point temperatures of the PbI2 and MAI powder, the positions of these sources were located at the center and 10\u202fcm to the right side of zone 1, respectively. The bl-TiO2/FTO substrates were placed in the down-flow on the left side of zone 2 set at temperatures of 60, 80 and 100\u202f\u00b0C. The furnace was then sealed and pumped down to a pressure of 1\u202fTorr under the control of Ar gas flow at 100 sccm.\nIn the two-step process, a small quartz tube with a 0.5-inch diameter was nested into a larger quartz tube (2-inch diameter). Crucibles containing PbI2 and MAI were separately placed into small and large tube furnaces. First, the temperature in zone 1 was gradually ramped up to 300\u00b0 C, and then an Ar flow was injected into the small tube at 100 sccm. After 15\u202fmin, a 180\u202fnm thickness of PbI2 was used to cover the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate. The second step involved the injecting Ar carrier gas into a large tube support to allow the reaction of MAI and PbI2 conversion to MAPbI3 perovskite. The perovskite layers were optimized for high crystallinity without PbI2 or MAI phases by varying different key parameters such as the gas flow rate, temperature, time, and the amounts of two different sources. After fabrication of the perovskite layer, an in-situ annealing process was performed in the second zone of the furnace immediately after deposition at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin.\nFor comparison, the 2-step spin-coating method was also used to prepare perovskite MAPbI3 onto bl-TiO2/FTO substrates. The first spin-coating step involved a 400\u202fmg/mL PbI2 (Sigma) solution that incorporated N as N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO2/FTO then dried at 80\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin. An MAI solution with a concentration of 40 mg/1 was dropped onto the PbI2-coated bl-TiO2/FTO substrates and let stand for 3\u20134\u202fmin to promote the reaction between PbI2 and MAI to form MAPbI3 at room temperature. The samples were spun at 2500\u202frpm for 25\u202fs and then annealed under an argon atmosphere at 100\u00b0 C for 1\u202fh via RTA (rapid thermal annealing).\n\nCounter electrodes were prepared by direct deposition of SWCNTs onto a MAPbI3/bl-TiO2/FTO. This substrate was mounted on the wall of an arc-discharge chamber for in-situ SWCNT deposition. A graphite rod was used as the carbon source. SWCNTs were synthesized under the optimized conditions with an arcing current density of 85 A/cm2 and an atmosphere of 5.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f104\u202fPa ambient hydrogen for 6\u202fmin []. The as-deposited SWCNTs had high porosity and a loose structure. The adhesion between the SWCNT network and the substrate was enhanced via chlorobenzene treatment, wherein 10\u202f\u03bcl dollops of chlorobenzene were dropped onto the surface of the SWCNT film, which was then heated at 100\u00b0 C for 10\u202fmin on a hot plate.\nFor reference devices, HTM was deposited via the drop-casting of a 10\u202f\u03bcl hole-transport solution of spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (180 mg/1\u202fmL) with the addition of 50\u202f\u03bcL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma)/acetonitrile (170 mg/1\u202fmL) and 20\u202f\u03bcL tert-butylpyridine (tBP, Sigma).\n\nOptical transmittances of the SWCNT/glass and the FTO/glass were measured using S-3100 UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. The resistivity, Hall mobility, and carrier density were measured using a four-point probe method and Hall-effect measurement of the van der Pauw geometry (HL-5500PC, Accent). The crystalline structure and the preferred orientation were characterized by XRD (Rigaku D/MAX-RC) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation and a nickel filter. The surface morphologies of the perovskite dye and the cross-sectional images of the solar cell devices were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TOPCON DS-130C). Photocurrent-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using an IVIUMSTAT under illumination from a Sun 3000 solar simulator composed of 1000\u202fW mercury-based Xe arc lamps and AM 1.5-G filters. Light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode. To test stability, we stored the fabricated perovskite devices under an ambient atmosphere that consisted of a white LED lamp with an equivalent intensity of 1 sun. The current-voltage J-V curves of the solar devices were measured daily at the same time and under the same conditions.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: CVD,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: SWCNTs | Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Unknown | Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Evaporation | Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.25,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The methods for cleaning indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) film fabrication can be found elsewhere. The CsPbI3 perovskite films were fabricated by a one-step method, where an equal molar\u00a0ratio of lead iodide (PbI2) and cesium iodide (CsI) were mixed in DMSO/dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed\u00a0solvent (v/v, 1/4). Three sulfobetaine zwitterions, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (NDSB201), 3-[2-hydroxyethyl(dimethyl)azaniumyl] propane-1-sulfonate (NDSB211), 3-(decyldimethylammonio) propane-1-sulfonate (SB3-10), were added to the CsPbI3 precursor solution to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3 films. A typical ratio of zwitterion added in CsPbI3 solution was 1.5% (weight ratio of zwitterion to CsPbI3). The zwitterion materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The precursor solutions were spin coated on top of PTAA substrates at a spin speed of 4,000\u00a0rpm. Then the films were annealed at 65\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, followed by annealing at 90\u2013100\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min.\nXRD of the films was recorded on a BrukerAXS D8 Discover diffractometer. The long-term stability study in Figure\u00a01E was conducted by storing the samples in dark conditions in air. The air humidity during the 60 testing days varied between 17% and 100%, with a typical humidity level of 30%\u201340%. Diamond software was used to simulate the XRD pattern of cubic-phase CsPbI3. The lattice constant and space group of CsPbI3 was from previous literature. The samples for XRD measurement in Figure\u00a02C were measured immediately after fabrication. No thermal annealing was applied to the samples before measurement. The samples were sealed in bottles in an N2 glovebox and then transferred from the glovebox to the XRD equipment to minimize the exposure to air.\nSEM of the films was recorded on an FEI Helios FIB/SEM 660. The grain size was determined on cross-section SEM images and estimated using Nano Measure software. The grains have an irregular shape. In order to get an accurate size distribution, the size of all the grains was measured in the same lateral direction, and all grains in the SEM images were included in the statistics without selection. The average grain size was derived by fitting the data with Gaussian distribution.\nFTIR was characterized using a Spectrum Two FTIR (PerkinElmer) with universal attenuated total reflectance (Single Reflection Diamond). The SB3-10 solution for the FTIR measurements in Figure\u00a02D was prepared by dissolving SB3-10 powder in DMF at 0.1\u00a0M concentration. Then 0.5\u00a0M CsPbI3 solution (DMF as solvent) was added to the SB3-10 solution to obtain the desired SB3-10/CsPbI3 ratios.\nAbsorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an Evolution 201\u00a0UV-visible spectrophotometer and iHR320 photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. The CsPbI3 precursor solution for UV-visible spectrum measurement in Figure\u00a02E was prepared by dissolving equal molar concentrations (1 M) of CsI and PbI2 in DMF/DMSO (v/v, 4/1). Then SB3-10 powder was gradually added to the solution to obtain the desired CsPbI3/SB3-10 ratios.\n\nThe fabrication of the device was conducted in a glovebox with the oxygen level lower than 100 particles per million. Details about the preparation of the CsPbI3 perovskite precursor solution can be found above. To increase the wetting property of cesium perovskite precursor on PTAA film, the PTAA-coated ITO substrate was pre-wetted by spinning 50\u00a0\u03bcL of DMF at 4,000\u00a0rpm for 5 s. 90\u00a0\u03bcL of cesium perovskite precursor was spin coated on PTAA substrate at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0s followed by 4,000\u00a0rpm for 45 s. The sample was drop casted with 90\u00a0\u03bcL toluene at 15\u00a0s after the start of spin coating. CsPbI3 solutions with different concentrations were used to control the thickness of the spun film. CsPbI3 films 200\u00a0nm, 300\u00a0nm, 400\u00a0nm, and 600\u00a0nm thick were made with 0.4 M, 0.65 M, 0.8 M, and 1.2\u00a0M solutions, respectively. Lead bromide and lead chloride were used to tune the composition of the perovskite precursor solutions to CsPb(I0.98Br0.02)3 and CsPb(I0.98Cl0.02)3. The spun films were annealed at 90\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. The argon plasma treatment was conducted with a PE-50 plasma cleaning system purchased from Plasma Etch. Typically, the cesium perovskite samples were treated at an operating power of 210\u00a0W for 2\u20136\u00a0s.

After deposition of PCBM layers, 25\u00a0nm C60 was thermally evaporated at a deposition rate of 0.5\u00a0\u00c5/s. The devices were finished by the evaporation of 7\u00a0nm 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and 100\u00a0nm aluminum or copper electrode. Cooling water was used to cool the samples to room temperature during the deposition of C60, BCP, and electrode. The area of the device was defined as the overlap of ITO with cathode. Slight variation in the area of the device was observed in devices from different batches. Optical microscopy was used to measure the active area accurately; the area typically measured 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.0\u00a0mm.\n\nThe J-V curves of the devices were measured in a glovebox. AM 1.5G irradiation (100\u00a0mW cm\u22122) with a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel 67,005, 150\u00a0W Solar Simulator) was used as the light source. A Schott visible-color glass-filtered (KG5 color-filtered) Si diode (Hamamatsu S1133) was used to calibrate the light intensity before photocurrent measurements. A Keithley 2400 Source-Meter was used to record the J-V curves. The scanning direction for the J-V measurements was from positive bias to negative bias. The voltage scanning rate was 0.05\u00a0V s\u22121. The steady-state photocurrent in Figure\u00a04D was measured by recording the champion device photocurrent under 0.86\u00a0V bias. Then the steady-state PCE was obtained by multiplying the measured current by 0.86 V.

The ZnO thin film were deposited by spin-coating dispersed ZnO solution onto the substrates at 3000\u00a0r.p.m. for 30\u00a0s and then annealed at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min to remove the organic solvent. The procedure was repeated several times to obtain a continuous smooth film with an appropriate thickness. CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) layer was spin-coated on the ZnO nanoparticle film using a two-step method.

To prepare a dense TiO2 electron transport layer, the cleaned FTO glass was coated with a TiO2 solution by a two-step spin-coating method with commercial titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 1-butanol solution (3:40, volume ratio), the first step was 700\u202frpm for 5\u202fs with an acceleration of 1000\u202frpm\u202fs\u22121, the second step was 2500 for 15\u202fs with a ramp-up of 2000\u202frpm\u202fs\u22121. The compact TiO2 coated FTO substrates were dried at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin and annealed at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin and then allowed to cool down to room temperature slowly. The thickness of the obtained TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) is about 50\u202fnm.\n\nA perovskite precursor solution was obtained through using one-step spin-coating procedure. The Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution was prepared containing PbI2 (1.1M), FAI (1.0M), PbBr2 (0.2M) and MABr (0.2M) indimethylsulphoxide/anhydrous dimethylformamide (1:4 (v:v)). Then, CsI, (5% volume, 1.5\u202fM, pre-dissolved in DMSO as a stock solution) was added to the precursor solution to achieve the desired triple cation composition. The sintered TiO2 substrate was cleaned in a plasma cleaner for 3\u202fmin before the perovskite precursor was spin-coated. The mixed precursor solution was spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 films in a two-step program at 1000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs and 6000\u202frpm for 20\u202fs.

The second step, 10\u202fs before the end of the procedure, 120\u202f\u03bcL of anti-solvent were quickly added to the rotating substrate. The substrate was then immediately transferred on a hotplate and heated at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin.

For concise, the above samples were denoted NPC0, NPC0.05, NPC0.25, NPC0.05, NPC0.75 and NPC1, respectively. Prior to use, the mixed anti-solvent was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5\u201310\u202fmin to form a uniform green liquid.\n\nThe hole-transport layer was subsequently deposited on the top of perovskite film using a spiro-OMeTAD solution (70\u202fmM in chlorobenzene).

The HTL was spin-coated at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs with 20\u202f\u03bcL of spiro-OMeTAD solution. Finally, Au electrode (approximately 100\u202fnm thick) was deposited on the top of HTL by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.\n\nThe crystallinity and structure of perovskite films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, D8 propulsion) with 2 Theta range from 5\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 at a scan rate of 10\u00b0/min.

After cooling to room temperature, the perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating at 4500\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s using the prepared precursor solutions which were maintained at 65\u00a0\u00b0C during the whole procedure, and toluene was dripped in the last 5\u00a0s. After that, the perovskite films were heated at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. After cooling to room temperature, PCBM (20\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121) was deposited by spin-coating at 2000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s. After dried overnight, 1\u00a0nm of LiF and100 nm of silver was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the contact.\n\nDevices were tested in air ambient. The J-V curves of the PSCs were measured using a Newport solar simulator with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under an AM 1.5G condition. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured by a Newport QE 200 system. UV\u2013vis spectra were measured using Agilent Cary 5000 UV\u2013vis-NIR spectrometer. The steady-state PL spectra were performed on a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. The SEM images were recorded on a Hitachi S4800 with an acceleration voltage of 10\u00a0kV.

Precursor mixed halide solutions were prepared with molar ratio (0.5PbCl2+0.5PbI2+2.2CH3NH3I) (640 mg/ml in DMF) stirred overnight at room temperature in ambient air and filtered with 0.45 \u00b5m PTFE filter. Perovskite thin films for UV\u2013vis optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements were prepared by spin-coating at 4000 rpm on different substrates from 50% diluted solution of the precursor solution. The fabrication of planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells started with cleaning pre-patterned ITO coated glass substrates sequentially with acetone, Hellmanex\u00ae, deionized water and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath. Different volumes of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000), DMSO and Zonyl FS300 were carefully mixed. The formulated PEDOT:PSS dispersion was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m RC filter and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for one minute. The PEDOT:PSS layer was then patterned and annealed for 10 min at 110 \u00b0C, cooled, rinsed with isopropanol by spinning at 4000 rpm to remove the excess surfactant (Zonyl) from the surface, and then annealed for another 10 min at the same temperature. The typical thickness of PEDOT:PSS was found to be ~130 nm. The precursor solution was spin-coated (1500 rpm for 20 s and then at 2000 rpm for 5 s) on top. After spin-coating, the substrates were immediately transferred to a hot plate at 110 \u00b0C where the colorless wet film is turned into glassy dark brown layer in few seconds and then further annealed for 45 min in ambient air. The procedure resulted in a 350\u2013400 nm thick perovskite absorber layer. PCBM (20 mg/ml in 1:1 volume ratio of chlorobenzene and chloroform) was spin coated (1500 rpm for 15 s and then at 2000 rpm for 15 s) on top of the perovskite layer, which yields a thickness of 50\u201370 nm. The entire processing up to this step is performed in ambient air. The sample was then transferred to a vacuum chamber located inside a nitrogen-filled glove box for the evaporation of the aluminum top electrode at <3\u00d710\u22126 mbar. The solar cells were encapsulated with a glass cover using a UV-curable epoxy sealant (Ossila E131), with a UV exposure time of 6 min. The fabricated solar cells with an active area of ~0.17 cm2 were tested on a LOT-QD solar simulator (LS0821). The radiation intensity was adjusted using a calibrated reference silicon diode to 100 mW/cm2. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were recorded by using a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) and a Jaissle 1002 potentiostat. The potentiostat operated in the two electrode configuration is a high performance current amplifier with a variable gain ranging from 10 to 108 V/A. In addition, the potentiostat allows measuring the EQE-spectra at different applied voltages. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a xenon lamp passing through a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone) with typical intensities in the range of 10\u2013100 \u03bcW. A filter wheel holding long-pass filters and a mechanical chopper was mounted between the xenon lamp and the monochromator. Chopping frequencies in the range of 73\u2013273 Hz were used. A calibrated silicon diode (Hamamatsu S2281) was used as a reference. A halogen lamp (Philips 50 W, 12 V) provided a variable white light bias to the solar cells while the EQE was measured. To determine the power conversion efficiency of the prepared solar cells, the illuminated area of the solar cell was defined using a shadow mask (0.13 cm2). In a first step the current-voltage curve was recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under illumination (solar simulator). The voltage was increased slowly (20 mV/s) and the current-voltage curve was determined close to steady state-conditions. To check for hysteresis a reverse voltage scan was performed decreasing the voltage by 20 mV/s. In a second step the short circuit current was recorded (steady state value) with a Keithley 2400. A maximum-power-point tracking algorithm was used to measure the steady-state power output of the solar cell. The external quantum efficiency was determined operating the solar cell under short circuit conditions and 1 sun illumination. The short circuit current calculated using the EQE-data allowed the determination of the spectral mismatch factor (MM) of our solar simulator. We found values >0.95 for the investigated devices. This mismatch factor was used to correct the maximum power point measurement. UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of perovskite films were recorded using a double beam UV\u2013vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer 1050) equipped with an integrating sphere. A Bruker Dektak XT profilometer was used to measure layer thicknesses. Photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra of various devices were measured using a Shamrock SR-303i monochromator and an Andor iDus Si-CCD. Samples were excited at 473 nm (5 mW) using a solid-state laser or a supercontinuum light source (NKT EXB6) connected to a VIS-NIR SuperK Select Box. A set of long-pass filters was used to avoid any distortion of the recorded spectra by the laser light. Electroluminescence spectra were recorded while applying different potentials with a Keithley 2401. The integrated electroluminescence was detected measuring the emitted photon current with a calibrated large-area Si-photodetector (Hamamatsu S2281) positioned close to the sample. Preliminary stability studies were performed on an ORIEL solar simulator. Surface and cross section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were made using a ZEISS 1540XB CrossBeam Scanning microscope equipped with a focused ion-beam (FIB) unit.

Ethanol (EtOH), iso-propanol (IPA), toluene and nitric acid (HNO3) were purchased from Samchun. Poly-triarylamine (PTAA) was purchased from EM index Co., Ltd.\n\nWe first synthesized TiO2 nano-sol by sol-gel method. 84\u202fg of TTIP was poured dropwise into 525\u202fg of distilled water with stirring at 80\u202f\u00b0C and the white precipitates were formed immediately. After these were dispersed in solution, 14\u202fg of HNO3 was added in solution and proceeded the reaction for 15\u202fh. The TiO2 nano-sol was then fully dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 18\u202fh in a convection oven.

The heat-treatment ensures the following orthogonal processability of perovskite solution in DMF because the remained hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles can be aged by condensation reaction so the TiO2 nanoparticles are tightly bonded by each other. For fabrication of rigid FAPbI3-xBrx perovskite solar cells, we deposited a TiO2 ETL by spin-coating 10\u202fwt% of TiO2 nano-sol in DMF on an oxygen plasma treated ITO/glass substrate at 3000 rom for 30\u202fs and dried it on a hot plate at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin. FAPbI3-xBrx perovskite film was then deposited on the TiO2/ITO/glass substrate.

Poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, MW = 4.0 \u00d7 105 g mol\u22121) was used as both the dispersant and the dopant for PEDOT. A PSS and distilled water solution was bubbled using nitrogen gas (99.999%) for 60 min at a rate of 3 L min\u22121 to prevent oxidation from the dissolved oxygen in the water. To this solution, EDOT monomer was added, and the solution was stirred using a mechanical stirrer for 30 min. The direct synthesis of the PEDOT:PSS dispersion was carried out by a Fe3+-catalyzed oxidative polymerization process. The oxidizing reagents iron(III) sulfate and sodium persulfate were dissolved in distilled water by sonication and added to the reaction solution. The polymerization was performed for 24 h at 10 \u00b0C with bubbling nitrogen gas. After the polymerization of PEDOT:PSS, the product was mixed with a mixture of cation and anion ion exchange resins for 1 h and filtered with a 30 \u03bcm mesh filter. Then, the PEDOT:PSS dispersion was homogenized with a high-pressure homogenizer at 1000 bar to prepare a well-dispersed solution. Finally, the dispersion was passed through a 5 \u03bcm filter. To control the ratio of PEDOT to PSS, the PEDOT:PSS dispersion was synthesized by changing the mass ratio of the EDOT monomer to PSS. All the obtained PEDOT:PSS dispersions had a solid content of 1.1%.\n\nThe thickness of the films was measured using a surface profiler (Alpha-Step 500, KLA-Tencor). The PSS/PEDOT ratio and chemical composition on the film surface were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo K-Alpha XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL, USA). The surface images of the polymer films were obtained using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park Systems XE-100) in non-contact mode. Using UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the WF was determined from the secondary cutoff region (Ecutoff) and the Fermi energy (EFermi), which were clearly defined and calculated by using \u03c6 = hv = 21.2 eV \u2212 Ecutoff + EFermi, where hv = 21.2 eV is the incoming photon energy from the He I source and a \u22125 V bias was applied to produce a clear boundary in the Ecutoff region. The transmittance spectra of the various PEDOT:PSS layers were obtained using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer).\n\nTo prepare the perovskite solution, methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) was synthesized according to a reported method.

We used the solvent engineering method to form the perovskite layer. The prepared MAI powder and PbI2 in a 1 M MAPbI3 solution were stirred in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 70 \u00b0C for 1 h. The completely dissolved solution was spin-coated on various PEDOT:PSS layers at 5000 rpm for 40 s. During spin-coating, toluene (1 mL) was dropped on the rotating substrate. After spin-coating, the film was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. After forming the perovskite layer on the PEDOT:PSS layer, a 2 wt% PC60BM in chlorobenzene solution was then spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100). Impedance spectroscopy was conducted using an impedance analyzer (IVIUM Tech.). A small AC voltage of 20 mV was applied at 0 V and VOC under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm\u22122). The AC voltage was applied with a frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 10 Hz.\n\nThe cross-sectional and surface morphologies of the perovskite films were measured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-7001F).

FAPbI3 based solar cells without FAI/IPA modification were also fabricated for comparison.\n\nFilm thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profiler. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from a Bruker D8 ADVANCE. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) was performed from 450 to 850 nm via Hitachi U-4100. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was used for surface morphology characterization. Current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the devices were measured in a N2-filled glovebox with a Keithley 2420 source measurement under AM1.5G, 100 mW cm\u22122 (Newport).

PbBr2 (99.999%) was obtained from Aldrich. All the above materials were used as received. ITO-covered glass substrates purchased from Ruilong Co., Taiwan were photolithographically patterned in our laboratory with HCl(aq). CH3NH3Br (MABr) was synthesized as reported previously. Uv/Vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded with Hitachi U-4100 and F-7000 spectrometers, respectively. The thickness of the films was measured with a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on the 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys was used to represent the film thickness. GIXRD data were collected in the 2\u03b8 range of 10\u201350 degrees on a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) using Cu K\u03b11 radiation equipped with a 2D detector.

The sputtering time for each layer is 200 seconds.\n\nThe procedure for fabricating the solar cells reported in this paper is very similar to that for preparing CH3NH3PbI3 based devices we reported previously. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on a heat pretreated patterned ITO under 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 15 min. To deposit the perovskite layer, first a layer of PbBr2 was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate from 0.5 M DMF solution using a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. And then CH3NH3Br (MABr) was spin-coated on top of the PbBr2 film from its isopropanol solution (with various concentrations, volumes and spin programs) to form a CH3NH3PbBr3 structure. Specifically, the highest efficiency device was fabricated with a concentration of CH3NH3Br/isopropanol (IPA) ca. 15 mg mL\u22121 (30 \u03bcl) at a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s in a 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm substrate. After the CH3NH3PbBr3 film was formed, 24 wt% PCBM (or ICBA) in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the surface of the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm, 30 s to be an acceptor layer. All the fabrication procedures were carried out under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Solvent annealing of the active (donor/acceptor) layer was carried out by covering the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM (or ICBA) film with a petri dish for 24 hours in a glove box before the film was sent into the vacuum evaporator for depositing an electrode. Finally the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM (or ICBA) film was transferred to a vacuum chamber to coat the Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm) electrode using thermal evaporation. The device area is 0.5 cm \u00d7 0.2 cm. I\u2013V curves of the cells were obtained using a Keithley 4200 source measuring unit under a simulated AM1.5G sun light (Wacom solar simulator) at 100 mW cm\u22122 and the light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. External quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air when the device was sealed with a three-bond sealer and measured right after taking out of the glove box. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Co., Taiwan). The cell for the stability test outside the glove box was fabricated using the same procedures except Ag, instead of Ca/Al, was used as an electrode.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbBr3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbBr,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown >> 100.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ca | Al,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation | Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Graphene oxides (GOs) were prepared via the previously reported method.

Afterwards, 40\u202fnm PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated (4000\u202frpm, 20\u202fs) on the substrates, and then baked in an oven at 160\u202f\u00b0C for 20\u202fmin under air conditions. To form the CsPbI3 precursor solution, CsI and PbI2 were dissolved in DMF with 1:1\u202fM ratio (0.5\u202fM) and stirred for 24\u202fh in air. 66\u202f\u03bcL of HI acid was added into 1\u202fmL precursor solution before prepare perovskite films. Then, the perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution on the substrates at 4000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs. In order to improve the film quality and film thicknesses, quickly drip coating process was repeated once more. The substrates were subsequently heated at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin on a hot plate under air conditions (Fig. S1a). The color of the films changed from transparent light yellow to dark brown. After that, 50\u202fnm PC61BM was spin-coated (1500\u202frpm, 20\u202fs) on the CsPbI3 films. The cathode consisting LiF (1\u202fnm) and Al (100\u202fnm) was deposited at a base pressure of 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fPa using a thermal evaporator. The device structure is illustrated in Fig. S1b and the active area of the devices is 0.1\u202fcm2 defined by a shadow mask.\nThe absorption spectra of the films on ITO glass were obtained on a scanning spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/vis, Palo Alto, CA). Bruker D8 ADVANCE was applied to record the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for perovskite films. Surface morphology of the films were characterized by Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thicknesses of the films were measured by Veeco Dektak 150 surface profiler. The current density\u2012voltage (J\u2012V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122 (AM 1.5\u202fG) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The photoluminescence spectra were obtained on a Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 Bench-top Spectrofluorometer.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60 | LiF,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Evaporation,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: CsPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: CsPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> CBD,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown >> 100.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown >> 10.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Al,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Unless otherwise noted, all the reagents and chemicals were purchased from the commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, TCI Chemicals, Alfa Aesar) and used without further purification.

The thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates of aluminum silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) were used to monitor the reaction progress.\n\nThe Scheme 1 presents the synthetic pathway of TP-FTzF-TP HTM. The intermediate of thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based material were synthesized by the procedures reported earlier . Compound, 5-di(furan-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (2) was synthesized by the reaction of furfural (1) and rubeanic acid. The precursor 2,5-bis(5-bromofuran-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (3) was achieved by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide. The final product was obtained by palladium catalyzed suzuki cross-coupling reactions between 3 and 4 under inert atmosphere. The details of synthesis procedure are described in the Supporting Information\u2020 (S-1).\n\nThe cleaned indium tin oxide glass (ITO glass; Samsung, 10\u201315\u202f\u03a9/sq, 80% transmittance in visible spectrum) substrates were treated with O2 plasma at a radio frequency (RF) power of \u223c20\u202fW for 30\u202fs under an oxygen flow of \u223c20 sccm to improve the uniformity with full surface coverage of the thin film. The O2 plasma treatment considerably enhanced the hydrophilicity of ITO layer, which improved the effective adhesion of HTM layer. Moreover, sufficient oxygenated species were introduced, and O2 plasma predominately removed the dust particles and traces of adsorbed impurities from the surface of ITO substrates. A freshly prepared solution of TP-FTzF-TP in toluene solvent was then immediately spin-coated onto O2 plasma treated ITO substrates. These substrates were then heated in an oven at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin. After cooling, the substrates were washed with toluene to remove any TP-FTzF-TP that was not strongly attached to the ITO electrode. Thereafter, the dissolved PbI2 solution in dimethylformamide (DMF) was spun on ITO (O2 plasma)/TP-FTzF-TP substrate at ~ 2000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, transferred quickly onto a hot plate and dried at 100\u202f\u00b0C to vapor the residual solvent. Later, CH3NH3I solution (as prepared elsewhere ) in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was spun at ~ 2000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs on top of dried PbI2 films at the room temperature and the spin coated PbI2/CH3NH3I stacking films were annealed at 100\u202f\u00b0C forming a thin perovskite layer.

The absorption properties were measured by using UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-670, Japan) and photoluminescence spectra (PL) was measured by the FP-6500 (JASCO) fluorometer in dilute chlorobenzene solvent. The Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was analyzed using WPG 100 Potentiostat/Galvanostat (WonATech) at a scan rate of 100\u202fmV/s with a three-electrode cell containing a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode. In this work, TP-FTzF-TP was dissolved in dichloromethane solvent and thin film was deposited on the glassy carbon working electrode by drop casting and dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fh under nitrogen. The CV measurement was performed in 0.1\u202fM of tetra butyl ammonium hexafluoro phosphate ([nBu4N]+[PF6]-) in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte and measured using Fc/Fc+ as an external reference. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained by using JEOL FT NMR spectrophotometer in CDCl3 as reference solvent (1\u202fH at 600\u202fMHz and 13\u202fC at 100\u202fMHz. The time resolved photoluminescence was performed by iHR320, TSCPC to study the charge extraction process at ITO/TP-FTzF-TP and ITO(O2 treated)/TP-FTzF-TP interfaces. To understand the electrical properties, the current density (J)\u2013voltage (V) measurements were performed for elucidating the performance of PSCs using computerized digital multimeter (model 2000, Keithley) with a variable load under one sun (1.5\u202fAM at 100\u202fmW/cm2). The simulated sunlight was supplied by using metal halide lamp of 1000\u202fW and the light intensity was adjusted to 100\u202fmW/cm2 (1.5\u202fAM), using Si photo detector fitted with a Ka-5 filter as a reference (calibrated at NREL, USA). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out by a specially designed IPCE system for solar cell by IVIUM technologies. Before performing the IPCE measurements, the system was calibrated with a silicon photodiode, using the NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as standard. The IPCE results of PSCs were collected as a function of wavelength from -300 to 1000\u202fnm using 75\u202fW Xe lamp as a light source for generating monochromatic beam at a low chopping frequency.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100.0 >> 100.0,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown,\n HTL_stack_sequence: TP-FTzF-TP,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The electron transporting TiO2 layer was spin coated (SETCAS Electronics Co., Ltd KW-4B) onto the FTO substrate at 5000\u202fr.p.m. for 30\u202fs, using precursor with 369\u202f\u03bcl titanium isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) and 0.15\u202fml 37\u202fwt% HCl solution dissolved in 5\u202fml ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%).

The substrate was cleaned sequentially by acetone and ethanol for 15 minutes using an ultrasonicator. We patterned gate electrode of Ti/Au (5/10\u202fnm) on the cleaned glass substrate using conventional photolithography, DC magnetron sputter deposition and lift-off processes. A 50\u202fnm thin Al2O3 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) process at 110\u202f\u00b0C as a gate dielectric layer. In order to prepare polystyrene-brush (PS-brush) solution, dimethyl chlorosilane terminated polystyrene (Polymer Source, Product No. P3881-SSiCl) was dissolved in toluene (Aldrich) solvent. Prior to spin-coating the PS-brush solution, the oxygen plasma cleaning (150\u202fW, 50 sccm, 20\u202fs) was applied to the Al2O3 surface.

During the heating, bonding reaction occurs at the interface between PS and Al2O3 surface. According to our previous work, the PS-brush produces covalent bonding between coil-like polymer chains and Al2O3 oxide layer, which is very robust to conventional organic solvent for usual photolithography process []. The surface of this 8\u202fnm-thin PS-brush is very hydrophobic enabling hysteresis reduction due to less interface trap density between dielectric and MoTe2 channel []. Following rinsing with copious amount of toluene, remaining unreacted PS after reaction was removed, so that only ultrathin PS-brush may remain. Then the sample was again heated at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh in a vacuum oven []. As the next step, MoTe2 nanosheet was mechanically exfoliated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and transferred onto the PS-brush treated Al2O3 substrate (See Figure S1a, b, and c where MoTe2 thickness information and its identity are characterized by atomic force microscopy scan and Raman spectroscopy, respectively).

For the opaque perovskite solar cell, 150\u202fnm of Au was evaporated on top of the PTAA film as the top electrode.\n\nFor the semi-transparent perovskite top cell, 10-nm-thick MoO3 was deposited using e-beam evaporation with a ratio of 0.1 As\u22121 as a buffer layer, and 150-nm thick IZO was deposited by RF-sputtering at room temperature as the transparent electrode. The RF-power of sputtering was 80\u202fW. Moreover, 30-nm-thick IZO was deposited on the top of the silicon solar cell to make the entire active area electrically conductive. Ag-coated PMMA particles of 0.5\u202fwt% (PMPMS-AG-1.53, Cospheric, 45\u201353\u03bcm size of PMMA particles are coated with 250\u202fnm thick Ag layer.) were diluted in a transparent Norland optical adhesive (NOA83H, Norland Products) and the TCA solution was mixed using a Voltex Mixer (VW-10, DAIHAN Scientific). The TCA solution was spin-coated onto the IZO of the silicon solar cell at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, and the TCA-coated silicon solar cell was mechanically attached to the IZO layer of the perovskite top cell and annealed at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. Also, the edges of their interface were sealed with an NOA at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin. The active area of the final tandem devices is 0.25\u202fcm2.\n\nThe theoretical reflectance and internal light energy flux of the device were computed using an optical simulation implemented using Python. For the multilayer tandem device, a generalized scattering matrix method was used. All layers were treated coherently except for c-Si. The c-Si layer was treated incoherently owing to its 525-\u03bcm thickness, which is larger than the coherence length of sunlight. The values of the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) with the wavelength were measured using an ellipsometer (Elli-SE-UaM8, Ellipso technology Co., Korea) or extracted from the literature. The maximum current density was calculated by multiplying the simulated internal light energy flux and the photon flux with a wavelength of 350\u20131200\u202fnm using MATLAB.\n\nSquare pieces (30\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202fmm) of a silicon substrate were cleaned using acetone, IPA, and DI water. The silicon native oxide on the silicon surface was removed by dipping into a buffered oxide etchant (BOE, HF/NH4F\u202f=\u202f7:1), and the Si substrate was rinsed with DI water and dried using a N2 gas flow. First, the Si substrate was immersed in a potassium hydroxide solution (45\u202fwt% KOH) at 95\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin to remove the damage to the silicon surface. After rinsing the substrate, the Si substrate was immersed into a solution mixed with KOH, IPA, and DI water (8:5:100 v/v) at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 40\u202fmin to fabricate the micro-pyramidal silicon mold and rinsed with DI water and dried using a N2 gas flow. To fabricate the PDMS AR foil, the PDMS solution (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Co.) was spin-coated onto the etched silicon mold at 3000\u202frpm and cured at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. Finally, the cured PDMS foil was peeled off the silicon mold.\n\nThe morphology and thickness of the perovskite and TCA films were observed using scanning electron microscopy (S-4800 Cold FE-SEM, Hitachi high-Technologies). The transmittance and absorbance of the perovskite films were measured using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer (Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies). The power conversion efficiencies of all devices were measured under simulated AM 1.5\u202fG (100\u202fmW/cm2) with a xenon lamp solar simulator. The J-V curves of the perovskite solar cells were measured using a black aperture mask of 0.0921\u202fcm2 in area, and the J-V curves of the silicon solar cells and tandem solar cells were measured using a black aperture mask of 0.25\u202fcm2 in area.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PTAA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.0921,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: TRUE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "PSCs with a structure of Glass/ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM/AgAl-Au composite NPs/LiF/AgAl were fabricated, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 .\nThe pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10\u202f\u03a9/sq were cleaned by ultra-sonication sequentially in detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 20\u202fmin.

The perovskite-precursor coated sample was heated and dried on a hot plate at 110\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin. The hole-transport material (HTM) was deposited on the grown perovskite absorber by spin-coating a spiro-OMeTAD solution at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. 100\u202fnm thick AgAl alloy film with an active area of 0.1\u202fcm2 was formed via evaporation on the Spiro-OMeTAD-coated film (Jiang et al., 2016). Finally, SiO2 nanosphere based ARCs were deposited on the front glass surface of the as-prepared PSC solar cell by spin-coating of the aged silica sol with various spin-coating speeds from 400 to 4000\u202frpm.\n\nThe morphologies of SiO2 nanosphere based ARC films were characterized by a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800). Optical spectra of SiO2 ARCs were examined and characterized by means of ultraviolet\u2013visible light (UV\u2013vis) spectrometer (Hitachi, U-3010). Photocurrent density\u2013voltage (J-V) measurements were performed using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 1000\u202fW Xenon lamp (Model No. 91192, Oriel, USA). The solar simulator was calibrated by using a standard silicon cell (Newport, USA). The light intensity was 100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122 on the surface of the test cell. During device photovoltaic performance characterization, a metal aperture mask with an opening of about 0.09\u202fcm2 was used.

AgNWs with average D / L\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0nm/81\u00a0\u00b5m were synthesized. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (10\u00a0\u03a9/\u25a1) were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd.\n\nThe preparation of NiOx nanoparticle ink is similar to a previously reported procedure (H. Zhang et al., 2016). Ni(NO3)2 (3.635\u00a0g) was dissolved in 2.5\u00a0ml of water. Ni(OH)2 was then precipitated with\u00a0~\u00a02.5\u00a0ml of 10\u00a0M NaOH solution. The light green precipitation was collected by centrifugation and washed thrice with deionized (DI) water. Afterwards, it was transferred to an oven at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and dried until the colour turned dark green. This solid was then transferred to an oven at 270\u00a0\u00b0C and kept for 2\u00a0h.

The NiOx (HTL), perovskite, PC60BM (ETL) layers were sequentially spin-coated on cleaned ITO/glass substrates. ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent (2% Hellmanex\u00ae III solution), DI water, acetone and IPA. After drying, the substrates were UV ozone treated for 10\u00a0min at 100\u00a0\u00b0C right before deposition.

Upon finishing, the substrate was promptly transferred on a hot plate at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and kept for 50\u00a0min. The PCBM solution (23\u00a0mg/ml in DCB) was spin-coated at 1300\u00a0rpm for 40\u00a0s to form an ETL on top of the perovskite layer.

The patterned area of the AgNW electrode was delimited by polyimide tape as mask. The active cell area was defined by the overlap of the patterned ITO and the patterned AgNW electrode, typically 0.09\u00a0cm2 for each cell.\nThe electrode thickness can be increased by repeating the spin-coating process.

After that, the samples were dried at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin to form ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 films. Then, the CBZ solution containing PCBM (20\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121) was spin-coated on ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 films to form ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM films. Some of these samples were used to prepare ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/ZnO:TIPD thin films. ZnO isopropanol dispersing solution was first diluted with anhydrous isopropanol in accordance with the volume ratio of 1:200, then ZnO:TIPD isopropanol solution was prepared by adding 10\u202f\u03bcl TIPD solution to 2\u202fml ZnO isopropanol diluents, which was further spin-coated on the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM to obtain ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/ZnO:TIPD thin films after drying (at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin). For the preparation of ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO:TIPD film without PCBM, the as-prepared ZnO:TIPD isopropanol solution was directly spin-coated on the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film. Finally, for the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM, ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/ZnO:TIPD and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO:TIPD films, 100\u202fnm Ag electrode is evaporated to complete the device structure in a vacuum condition.

The XRD pattern was measured by X-ray diffractometry (DX-2700, Dandong Haoyuan Instrument Company, China). UV\u2013visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 5000 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. The strady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on the HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorometer system. The 510\u202fnm light is incident form the ITO side as the photon excition Time-resolved fluorescence analyses were measured with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980 photoluminescence spectrometer and the time-resolved PL decay is probed at 775\u202fnm after light excitation. Reconvolution fit analysis was used to fit a measured sample decay to a model function with three exponential terms. The quality of the fit was estimated by the parameter \u03c72 (0.90\u2264\u03c72\u202f\u2264\u202f1.10) and the symmetrical distribution of the residuals about the zero axis. The AFM and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) tests were performed by Bruker Dimension FastScan Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM). Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were collected by the electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 3, Ametek, USA) under AM1.5G illumination (100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122). The light intensity was calibrated with a NIST-certified silicon reference solar cell (Newport 532 ISO1599). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under darkness by the CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Device Company, Shanghai, China). The measured EIS results were simulated using the Z-view software. All J-V and EIS measurements of as-prepared solar cells without encapsulation were performed in ambient atmosphere (55% relative humidity) at room temperature.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 5,\n HTL_stack_sequence: CuInS2 | Al2O3-np,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.04,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The p-i-n inverted MAPbI3 PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PTAA/ MAPbI3/PCBM/Bphen/Cu.

The precursor is a mixture of PbI2 (550\u2009mg/ml) and MAI (550\u2009mg/ml) in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF): dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Firstly, pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates were treated by ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevious AI 4083) layer was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 \u00b0C for 15 min in air.

Then the mixture was concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The obtained colorless crystals were collected and then transferred to a vacuum drying oven at 100 \u00b0C for 2 days (for convenience, the product is denoted as Ge-gly). A typical synthetic procedure of CGS NCs is briefly described below. First, 1.5 mmol copper(II) chloride dihydrate, 0.75 mmol Ge-gly and 10 mL oleylamine were mixed at room temperature and cycled between vacuum and nitrogen three times in a 100 mL three neck flask connected to a Schlenk line. Afterward, the mixture was kept at 120 \u00b0C under vacuum for 40 min with stirring and then the temperature was raised to 210 \u00b0C (solution A). 4 mL oleylamine and 2.25 mmol S powder were mixed in a separate round flask at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum. When the S powder was completely dissolved, the mixture was then cooled to room temperature (solution B). Finally, solution B was injected into solution A under vigorous stirring and the reaction was maintained for 20 min. The mixture was cooled to \u223c100 \u00b0C, followed by adding 5 mL toluene and 40 mL isopropanol. The nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant, which contained the unreacted precursor and byproducts, was discarded. The precipitate was washed again with 7.5 mL toluene and 45 mL isopropanol to remove the excess oleylamine from CGS NPs.\n\nMethylammonium iodide was synthesized by reacting 17.4 mL methylamine (40 wt% in water) and 16.6 mL hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water) in a 250 mL round bottom flask at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h with stirring. After the reaction, the white solid of MAI was recovered by rotary evaporation and then washed with diethyl ether and recrystallized twice with ethanol. The CH3NH3I powder was collected and dried at 50 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, CH3NH3I and PbI2 (Aldrich) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3 in volume) in 1 M concentration. The solution was stirred overnight at 60 \u00b0C and filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF filters before spin-coating.\n\nPrior to the deposition of the TiO2 compact layer, the FTO substrate (15 \u03a9 sq\u22121) was etched with zinc powder and 2 M HCl to obtain the desired pattern. The etched FTO substrate was sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone, isopropanol and de-ionized water for 40 min each and then treated in a UV/O3 cleaner for 20 min. A dense TiO2 blocking layer of ca. 40 nm thickness was spin-coated onto FTO with a mixture solution of 140 \u03bcL of titanium isopropoxide, 2 mL of ethanol, and 26 \u03bcL of HCl (2 M) at 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h in a muffle furnace. To deposit perovskite films, the CH3NH3PbI3 solution (18 \u03bcL) was first dropped onto a TiO2 coated FTO substrate (1.5 cm \u00d7 2 cm). The substrate was then spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s. During this process, anhydrous chlorobenzene (100 \u03bcL) was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate twelve seconds ahead of the end of rotation. Subsequently, the obtained films were then dried at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and further annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min to form crystallized MAPbI3. To complete the fabrication of devices, two hole transporting materials (spiro-OMeTAD and CGS) were spin-coated onto the perovskite films, separately. For the deposition of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, 73.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD was first dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene, and then 28.8 \u03bcL 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 18.8 \u03bcL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) were added. The as-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 films at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For the deposition of the CGS HTL, the synthesized CGS NPs were dispersed in 1-hexanethiol to form a stable ink with a concentration of 200 mg mL\u22121. The CGS NP ink was then spin-coated onto the perovskite films at various speeds for 30 s. In the experiment, we adopt a facile method to control the thickness of CGS by changing the spin speed. When the spin speed was increased from 1000 rpm to 7000 rpm with a step of 1000 rpm, the thickness of CGS decreased from 390 nm to 60 nm. After that, the films were transferred into a heated vacuum chamber placed in a glove box to remove the solvent. Finally, device fabrication was completed by thermally evaporating 80 nm of gold layer with a mask (well-defined area size of 0.12 cm2).\n\nThe crystal structure characterization of MAPbI3 and CGS thin films was conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/Max-rA) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). The Raman spectra of CGS films were recorded at room temperature using a LABRAM-HR micro-Raman system in the back-scattering configuration with laser sources of 514 nm. The surface morphology and elemental composition were determined by field emission SEM (FE-SEM Sirion 200). Steady-state photoluminescence was measured using a LabRamHR system with excitation at 514 nm. AFM measurements were performed on an XE-7 scanning probe microscope in non-contact mode (Park systems, Korea). The optical absorption spectrum was recorded on a UV-vis-365-type spectrophotometer in the range of 200\u20131600 nm. Contact angles were measured using a CAM instrument (Data-Physics, Germany). The current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characterizations were conducted using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm\u22122) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA), and the solar simulator illumination intensity was calibrated using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The poly-Si modules are kept at maximum power point in between periodic current-voltage (IV) sweeps (once every minute). Each module has a PT100 temperature sensor fixed to its backplane. Current and voltage at the maximum power point (IMPP, VMPP) and temperature measurements are taken every 15\u202fs. The perovskite mini-modules were kept at open-circuit between IV sweeps conducted once every 15\u202fmin. All mini-modules also had PT100 sensors constantly reading the module temperature. For these tests, all monitored modules were mounted in-plane towards the sun at an angle of 36\u00b0 (the optimum for this latitude).\nDuring the outdoor testing, the incident irradiance was monitored using IMT silicon solar reference cells. The weather conditions were constantly recorded using a dedicated weather station setup. The outdoor measurement setup conforms to the ISOS-O2 outdoor measuring protocol (Reese et al., 2011).

The former solution with 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 14.4 \u03bcL) was mixed with the Li-TFSI solution (8.8 \u03bcL) for 30 min at 70 \u00b0C. Then, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. All procedures were performed in air.\nFinally, gold (Au) electrodes were evaporated as top electrodes using a metal mask for the patterning. Layered structures of the prepared photovoltaic cells are denoted as FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The prepared perovskite photovoltaic devices were stored at 22 \u00b0C and \u223c30% humidity.\n\nJ\u2013V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm\u22122, with the use of an AM 1.5 solar simulator (San-ei Electric, XES-301S). J\u2013V measurements were performed using a source measurement unit (Keysight, B2901A Precision SMU). The scan rate and sampling time were \u223c0.08 V s\u22121 and 1 ms, respectively. Four cells were tested for each cell composition and the reported values are the averages of these four measurements (\u03b7ave). The solar cells were illuminated through the sides of the FTO substrates and the illuminated area was 0.0784 cm2. EQEs (Enli Technology, QE-R) of the cells were also measured using a source meter (Keithley Tektronix, 2450). The microstructures of the cells were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D2 PHASER) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6010PLUS/LA) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).\n\nThe electronic structures of the perovskite crystals were calculated for the single-point with the experimental parameters obtained from XRD, through ab initio quantum calculations based on the unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) method. We used density functional theory (DFT) and the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE)-based hybrid function and unrestricted B3LYP (UB3LYP) with LANL2MB as the basis set (Gaussian 09). The metal-incorporated MAPbI3 cubic structures were treated as a cluster model with supercells of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 fixed to have a positive charge of +8. A lattice constant of 6.391 \u00c5 was used for the perovskite compounds with a cubic crystal system. The numbers of quantum spins in the metal (M)-incorporated MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 crystals were assumed to be doublet (S = 1/2) states at M = Cu2+ and a singlet (S = 0) state at M = Pb2+, respectively. As an isolated dilution system, the mole ratio of the transition metal to Pb metal was adjusted to be 1:26. The concentration of the metal atom was maintained at less than 5% so as not to break crystal symmetry by suppression of strong exchange interactions in the perovskite crystal. Alkali metal elements (i.e., Na+, K, Rb+, and Cs+) were substituted for MA+ sites at contents of less than 12%. We calculated the total and partial DOS (TDOS and pDOS), the occupancy of the 3d orbital on the transition metal, 6s, 5p, and 6p orbitals of the I and Pb atoms around the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and the HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap (Eg). The vibration modes in infrared spectroscopy (IR) spectra were also calculated by DFT using the frequency mode. The Gibbs energy (G) and enthalpy (H) were obtained by the IR calculation, and the entropy was calculated by using G = H \u2212 TS, where T is 298 K.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: CuBr2; RbI,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 140,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 22.0; 22.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1176,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 12.5,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 104,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.0784,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "All chemicals were purchased as following: Lead (\u2161) iodide (PbI2, ultra dry, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), 1-octadecene (ODE, technical grade 90%, Sigma Aldrich), oleic acid (OA, technical grade 90%, Alfa Aesar), oleylamine (OLA, technical grade 70%, Sigma Aldrich), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%, Alfa Aesar), methyl acetate (MeOAc, extra pure grade \u226599.5%, Duksan), n-hexane (anhydrous, Alfa Aesar), n-octane (extra pure Alfa \u226599%, Acros Organics), TiO2 precursor solution (SC-BT060, Sharechem), TiCl4 aqueous solution (Sharechem), lead (\u2161) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2, 99.999%, Sigma Aldrich), lead (\u2161) acetate trihydrate (Pb(OAc)2\u00b73H2O, 99.995%, Alfa Aesar), sodium acetate (NaOAc, 99.995%, Sigma Aldrich), cesium acetate (99.998%, Alfa Aesar), formamidinium iodide (FAI, GreatcellSolar), ethyl acetate (EtOAc, extra pure grade \u226599.5%, Duksan), 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, \u226599.5%, Lumtec), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma Aldrich), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, \u226598%, Alfa Aesar), acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma Aldrich), 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP, 96%, Sigma Aldrich) and 2-amylpyridine (\u226598.0%, TCI).

The flask was filled with N2 gas and degassed again. After repeating this process 3 times, the Cs-oleate solution was prepared and stored in N2. For synthesizing CsPbI3-PQDs, PbI2 (0.5\u202fg) and ODE (25\u202fmL) were added to a 100\u202fmL volume of 3-neck round flask, and degassed for 30\u202fmin\u202fat 115\u202f\u00b0C. Pre-degassed OA (2.5\u202fmL) and OLA (2.5\u202fmL) were injected into the flask, and then the flask was degassed for 30\u202fmin\u202fat 115\u202f\u00b0C. After the flask was filled with N2 gas, the temperature was raised up to 185\u202f\u00b0C and Cs-oleate (2\u202fmL) was rapidly injected into the flask. After 10\u202fs, the flask was quenched to room temperature by immersing into ice water. To isolate desired CsPbI3-PQDs, MeOAc (35\u202fmL) as a polar anti-solvent was added into as-synthesized CsPbI3-PQD solution (15\u202fmL) and centrifuged at 5000\u202frpm for 3\u202fmin. After removing the supernatant, the precipitated CsPbI3-PQDs were dispersed in hexane (5\u202fmL) and MeOAc (7\u202fmL) was added. The solution was centrifuged at 5000\u202frpm for 3\u202fmin and the supernatant was removed. The precipitated CsPbI3-PQDs was dispersed hexane (15\u202fmL) and the solution was centrifuged at 5000\u202frpm for 3\u202fmin in order to remove the aggregated CsPbI3-PQDs. The precipitates were removed and the supernatant was collected and stored in the dark at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 48\u202fh. After removing the precipitated products, hexane was dried under vacuum and the dried CsPbI3-PQD pellets were dispersed in octane with a concentration of ~75\u202fmg/mL [,].\n\nThe patterned-FTO substrates were cleaned by sonicating sequentially in detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol each for 10\u202fmin. The cleaned FTO substrates were exposed to UV in an UV/O3 instrument in order to eliminate contaminants and make the surface hydrophilic for TiO2 coating. Sol-gel-derived compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer used as an electron-transporting layer (ETL) in solar cells was fabricated on the patterned-FTO substrates. The precursor solution was purchased from Sharechem for convenience but the contained chemicals and recipe were same with the reported sol-gel method by Swarnkar et al [,]. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the FTO substrates at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, and then the substrates were annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were soaked in TiCl4 aqueous solution (120\u202fmM) at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. The substrates were washed with deionized water and annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. TiCl4 treatment enhances the interfacial quality of the c-TiO2 layer. For the fabrication of CsPbI3-PQD solids based on solid state ligand exchange, CsPbI3-PQD solution in octane (75\u202fmg/mL) was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2/FTO substrates at 1000\u202frpm for 20\u202fs followed by 2000\u202frpm for 5\u202fs. The as-cast CsPbI3-PQD film was soaked in the ligand solution (the respective ionic salts in MeOAc) and spin-dried. And then, the ligand-treated film was washed using neat MeOAc and spin-dried. Ligand treatment and washing process were performed under the relatively-controlled humidity condition from 15% to 20% for efficient ligand exchange. This procedure was repeated 4\u20136 times to build up desired thickness (~300\u202fnm). Spiro-MeOTAD used as a HTL in solar cells was spin-coated at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared as follows: spiro-MeOTAD (72.3\u202fmg), chlorobenzene (1\u202fmL), 2-amylpyridine (28.8\u202f\u03bcL) and Li-TFSI (17.5\u202f\u03bcL) solution in acetonitrile with the concentration of 520\u202fmg/mL.

PCBM dissolved in chlorobenzene (20\u202fmg/mL) was spin-coated at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs under a N2-filled glove box.\n\nCurrent density\u2212voltage (J\u2212V) curves of solar cell devices were carried out under a simulated air mass 1.5 global spectrum (AM 1.5G) and 100\u202fmW/cm2 illumination (1 sun) using a Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator with a xenon lamp and a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The J\u2212V curves of all solar cell devices were measured with an active area of 0.096\u202fcm2 defined by covering the mask. The J\u2212V measurement was conducted from forward bias (1.3\u202fV) to reverse bias (\u22120.05\u202fV) at 100\u202fmW/cm2 and AM1.5\u202fG. The step size was 13.5\u202fmV and the delay time was 10\u202fms. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a Newport Oriel QuantX300 with an Oriel Cornerstrone 130 monochromator. The EQE spectra were scanned from 300\u202fnm to 800\u202fnm with an interval wavelength of 20\u202fnm. The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) of electron-only devices was obtained from the J\u2012V measurements using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under dark conditions. Trap-state density (N t) was calculated from trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL), obtained from the SCLC curve, using the equation as follows []: VTFL=qNtL22\u03b5\u03b50 where q is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of CsPbI3-PQD solids, \u03b5 is the relative permittivity of CsPbI3 (\u03b5\u202f=\u202f6.32 \u03b5 0) and \u03b5 0 is the vacuum permittivity, respectively.

In a typical procedure, 52 mL of KOH methanol solution (354 mM) was first added dropwise into a 100 mL of Zn(CH3COO)2\u00b72H2O methanol solution (107 mM) in a 65 \u00b0C water bath and continuously stirred for 2.5 h. Then, the products were washed with anhydrous methanol solution for several times to remove residual precursors. Finally, the prepared ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed into a 20 mL mixture solution of n-butanol\u2013methanol\u2013chloroform (14:1:1 volume ratio), where the content of ZnO nanoparticles is about 20 mg mL\u22121. The obtained ZnO solution was filtered by a 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE syringe filter before spin-coating.\n\nFTO rigid glass substrates (1.5 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm) were etched by zinc power and 2 M HCl, and treated successively with abluent, deionized water, acetone and UV-ozone to achieve a clean surface. After that, the ZnO nanoparticles solution was spin-coated over the FTO substrate at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then dried for 10 min at room temperature. This process was repeated several times to obtain an optimal thickness of ZnO film. Consecutively, the ZnO film was aged 24 h in air at room temperature. Then, solution of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (460 mg mL\u22121) was spin-coated onto the surface of ZnO films at 3000 r.p.m. for 20 s. After drying the PbI2 layer, the substrate with both ZnO and PbI2 layers was immersed into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL\u22121) for 1 min, followed by thermal annealing at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min (FTO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3).

CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx was dissolved in a cosolvent of DMSO and GBL (vol. ratio = 3:7) with Pb2+ and CH3NH3I (molar ratio = 1.4 M:1.3 M). The mixture was stirred at 60 \u00b0C overnight in a glovebox. To synthesize the CdSe/PCBM composite, three different mass ratios (1%, 5%, and 10%) of CdSe and PCBM powder were dispersed in chlorobenzene.\n\nITO was cleaned by sonication using detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, ultraviolet and ozone (UV-Ozone) treatment for 15 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was coated on a prepared ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 1 min by spin coating. The substrate was then heated on a hot plate at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min in air. We preheated the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx mixed solution at 70 \u00b0C.

After that, the obtained layer was spin-coated at 5500 rpm for 60 s. Soon afterwards, it was quenched by dropping 1000 \u03bcL of anhydrous toluene at 45 s, followed by annealing at 100 \u00b0C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, a layer of CdSe/PCBM was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 2500 rpm for 40 s. 0.6 mg mL\u22121 Rhodamine 101 solution in isopropanol was deposited by spin coating at 1500 rpm for 40 s onto the PCBM layer.

The energy cutoff was set to 480 eV. For the exchange and correlation functional, we used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) format. We note that the Heyd\u2013Scuseria\u2013Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) and inclusive of the spin\u2013orbit coupling effect, and/or quasiparticle self-consistent GW methods were discussed before. However, by considering the large systems of our models and comparing the results of different functionals, we chose to use the GGA-PBE format. The CH3NH3PbI3 surface was considered with a thickness of 8 atomic layers and the CdSe film with 15 layers, and a vacuum thickness of 15 \u00c5 was added.

Lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were obtained from TCI. Cesium iodide (CsI) was purchased from GmbH. Phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) was synthesized. 10 ml of phenylethylamine was diluted in 20 ml of anhydrous ethanol and cooled in an ice bath. With vigorous stirring, 20 ml of HI (55 wt% in H2O, Sigma Aldrich) was slowly added dropwise. After stirring for 20 min, a colorless precipitate was filtered. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether and dissolved in methanol twice. To obtain pure white crystals, the PEAI precipitate was recrystallized twice and stored in a vacuum oven overnight to dry.\n\nFTO glass substrates (Nippon sheet glass) were sequentially cleaned with detergent solution, acetone, and ethanol. And then by spray pyrolysis deposition, a compact TiO2 layer was coated on the cleaned FTO substrate heated at 450 \u00b0C. The precursor solution was prepared by diluting titanium diisopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (0.6 ml:10 ml). After cooling, a mesoporous TiO2 film was prepared by coating a diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) solution in ethanol. Right after spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s, the substrates were sintered on a hot plate at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. For doping Li on TiO2, the films were treated with 0.1 M lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate solution (Li-TFSI, Aldrich) in acetonitrile by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 10 s, and were finally baked at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min again. The lead excess (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 precursor solution was prepared by mixing FAI (1.1 M), PbI2 (1.15 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in a mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (volume ratio). Another 1.15 M solution of CsPbI3 was also prepared in DMF:DMSO (with the same volume ratio). For triple cation mixed perovskite solution, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI3 solutions were mixed in 10 vol% ratio. The solution was then spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and continuously at 4000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glove box. After entering the second step, 100 \u03bcl of anhydrous trifluorotoluene was poured 15 seconds before the completion of the process. Films were then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 60 min. For forming an additional 2D perovskite film on top of this perovskite film, cooled substrates were treated with a PEAI isopropanol solution. 100 \u03bcl of PEAI solution (15 mg ml\u22121) were spin-coated on the as-prepared perovskite films at 4000 rpm, which is similar to the anti-solvent dropping method. Finally, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s. A 70 mM spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving in chlorobenzene with 4-tert-butylpyridine, Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and Co[t-BuPyPz]3[TFSI]3 (FK209) in acetonitrile at a molar ratio of spiro:FK209:Li-TFSI:TBP of 1:0.03:0.5:3.3.

The absorbance and reflectance measurements were performed with an integrating sphere using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lamda). Photoluminescence were measured using a Flourolog-3 (Horiba Scientific) with an excitation laser of 450 nm. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained on a ZEISS Merlin at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired using a Park NX10 (Park system) and analyzed with XEI AFM data analysis software.\nTime-resolved PL experiments were performed with a spectrophotometer (Gilden Photonics) using a pulsed source at 480 nm (Ps diode lasers BDS-SM). The time-resolved signals were recorded by a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting detection technique with a time resolution of 1 ns.\nFor the STEM and STEM-EDX measurements, cross-sectional lamellae were prepared from the devices using the conventional focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique on a Zeiss Nvision 40. To reduce FIB induced damage, a final thinning in the FIB at 5 kV using a beam current of 80 pA was employed. To minimize exposure to air, the data were acquired just after the FIB preparation. STEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were performed on an aberration-corrected FEI Titan Themis 60-300 transmission electron microscope in scanning mode at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

The illumination was tuned with an Oriel DC Regulated illuminator in order to make Voc = 880, which corresponds to the operation region of the samples (Voc = 1.1 V at 1 sun). With fitting purposes, in addition to the elements included in the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4A, extra series resistive and inductive elements were also considered. In the equivalent circuit Rb and Cb are the resistive and capacitive elements, respectively, behind the high frequency arc in the Nyquist plot, whose physical meaning is related to dielectric and chemical bulk properties. On the other hand, RS and CS analogously characterize the high frequency arc whose nature may be associated with interface phenomena.\nUltra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum. The photon line width was \u223c250 meV and the minimum spot size was \u223c1 mm. He I photons (21.2 eV) with a bias of 5 eV were used to acquire the spectra at a normal emission level. The photoelectrons were collected using a Sigma Probe (Thermo VG Scientific) with 50 meV precision.\n\nPhotovoltaic performance was evaluated using commercial solar simulators (Oriel, 450 W, Xenon, AAA class). The light intensity was matched to one sun (AM 1.5G or 100 mW cm\u22122) by calibrating with a Si reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG5, Newport), and it was done before each measurement. Current\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves of the PSCs were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The voltage scan rate was 25 mV s\u22121 in forward and reverse scans. Devices were not preconditioned such as light soaking or a pre-voltage bias applied before starting the measurement. The cells were masked with an active area of 0.16 cm2. EQE was measured using an IQE200B (Oriel) without bias light.\nStability tests were carried out in a sealed cell holder with a glass cover (house made), where argon gas was filled to remove the residual water and oxygen from the holder. For the ambient condition test, the argon gas was turned off and the humidity and oxygen were not controlled, and the cells were encapsulated with surlyn (solaronix) and glass coverslips. In this case, the humidity was not controlled but the laboratory humidity was monitored, which ranged from 30 to 60% relative humidity at room temperature. In the glass cover, 0.1225 cm2 masks were equipped. The LED lamp used in the system had a light intensity of 100 mW cm\u22122. J\u2013V curves were recorded on an electronic system using a 22 bit delta-sigma analog to digital converter. A scan rate of 25 mV s\u22121 with a step size of 5 mV was used and the devices were kept at the temperature of 50 \u00b0C. Every 2 hours the J\u2013V measurement and maximum power point tracking were performed. A reference Si-photodiode was placed in the same holder to check the intensity of the light.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown | Li-TSFI,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: Cs0.1FA0.76MA0.14PbBr0.51I2.49,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: CsFAMAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 50.0; 50.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 800,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 20,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 0,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.16,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "FTO glass (Nippon sheet glass) substrates were sequentially cleaned with the detergent solution, acetone, and ethanol.

In the final step, H2O (200 mL) was added, followed by a slow addition of H2O2 (5\u20137 mL, 30%); in this stage, the colour of the solution changed from brown to yellow. The mixture was centrifuged and washed with HCl aqueous solution (5%), followed by repeated washing with H2O and then with DMF. The resulting solid was dispersed in DMF with agitation followed by ultra-sonication. The obtained brown dispersion was centrifuged (30 min, 3000 rpm) to remove unreacted graphite or agglomerated sheets.\n\nThe synthesized CH3NH3I powder was mixed with PbI2 (Alfa Aesar) in a 1:1 molar ratio in anhydrous DMF at 70 \u00b0C for 3 h with a CH3NH3PbI3 (PSK) concentration of 45 mass%. Graphene oxide was dispersed in DMF (concentration 0.5 mg mL\u22121). A blended solution was prepared on mixing the stock solution of perovskite and graphene oxide solution. The concentration of perovskite in both pristine PSK solution and PSK:GO solution was fixed to 45 mass%; PSK:GO solutions were prepared with graphene oxide (GO) at mass concentrations of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.075 mg mL\u22121.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were analyzed as a function of wavelength from 300 to 800\u202fnm using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: FA0.85MA0.15PbBr0.45I2.55,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: FAMAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 90,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PTAA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 25.0; 25.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 2400,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 16.8,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 60,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.09,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received, unless otherwise specified. TEM images were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100 LaB6 HRTEM instrument. UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-5100 spectrophotometer.\n\nSilver nanoprism colloids were prepared according to the literature . Briefly, a solution of sodium citrate (3.0\u00d710\u22122 M, 1 mL) and a solution of silver nitrate (1.0\u00d710\u22122 M, 1 mL) were added to pure water (97 mL) with rapid stirring. A solution of sodium boronhydride (5.0\u00d710\u2212 3 M, 1 mL) was then added dropwise to the mixture, under vigorous magnetic stirring. The solution turned yellow immediately. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was irradiated with a Na lamp (Philips 100-W, \u03bb=589 nm), the emission spectrum of which is displayed in Fig. S1. The typical power of the light on the solution was approximately 0.22 W cm\u22122 . The color of the solution changed gradually from yellow to green, eventually turning blue after 3\u20136 h of irradiation. Blue (\u03bb max \u2245700 nm in the extinction spectrum) is the typical color of a colloidal Ag nanoprism solution. The lengths of the sides of the Ag nanoprisms were approximately 70\u00b120 nm.\n\nA solution 200 \u03bcL sample of 10\u22123 M PVP (10\u22123 M, 200 \u00b5L) was added into 1.8 mL of a solution of the as-prepared Ag nanoprism colloid solution (1.8 mL) in a vial. After 20 min, a solution of 200 \u03bcL of 10\u22123 M KBr (10\u22123 M, 200 \u00b5L) was added into the PVP-treated colloid solution to initiate the etching process. The color of the colloidal solution changed gradually from blue to indigo, purple, purplish red, pink, orange, and yellow over a period of approximately 30 min. These color changes of the Ag colloids were correlated to the shape transformations of the nanomaterials\u2014from Ag nanoprisms to round Ag NPLs\u2014in the presence of halide ions. Time-dependent UV\u2013vis spectra and TEM images were recorded to trace the shape evolutions of silver nanostructures. All the UV\u2013vis spectra were recorded in a Hitachi U-5100 spectrometer. Typically suitable protecting reagents, such as MHA, which have been found to form a self-assembly monolayers immediately on the surfaces of Ag NPLs surface are required to prevent the further bromide-mediated sculpturing process caused by the bromide ions . Hence, a 100 \u03bcL sample of 10\u2212 4 M MHA was added into the colloid solution to terminate the etching reaction process when the solution displayed the desired color. Finally, this approach, highly stable Ag nanostructures with the desired SPR wavelengths were obtained.\n\n\nAll PV cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. Glass/ITO substrates [Sanyo, Japan (8 \u03a9/\u25a1)] were sequentially patterned lithographically, cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried on a hot plate at 140 \u00b0C for 10 min, and treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P-VP AI4083) was passed through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter; different ratios of Ag NPLs were added prior to deposition on ITO (thickness: ca. 45 nm) through spin-coating at 3000 rpm in air, the sample was then dried at 140 \u00b0C for 20 min in a glove box. Blends of P3HT or PTB7 with PCBM or PC71BM at defined ratios (1:1 for P3HT; 1:1.5 for PTB7) were stirred overnight in o-DCB, filtered through a 0.2-\u00b5m polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter, and then spin-coated (600\u20131000 rpm, 30 s) on top of the PEDOT:PSS/Ag NPLs layer. The device was completed by depositing a 30-nm-thick layer of Ca and a 100-nm-thick layer of Al at pressures of less than 10\u2212 6 Torr. PVSK cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. The PVSK precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and lead (II) chloride at ratio of 3:1 (molar ratio) at 25 wt% in DMF and continuously stirring at 60 \u00b0C in the dark overnight. PVSK devices, having the layered configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (w/ or w/o Ag NPLs)/CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx /PC61BM/Al, were fabricated using methods similar to those reported previously (Fig. 1c) . Prior to the deposition of the PVSK layer, the PEDOT:PSS film was preheated at 60 \u00b0C for 5 min. The precursor solution was also preheated at 60 \u00b0C for 5 min and then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS. PCBM was spin-coated (2000 rpm) from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL\u2212 1). The layers of Al (100 nm) were deposited thermally under vacuum. The active area of the all the devices was 10 mm2. The cell performance was measured inside a glove box. The current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) properties of the OPV devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel\u00ae Sol2A Class ABA Solar Simulators) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm\u22122). The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell and a KG-5 filter. EQEs were measured using an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurement system to calibrate the current densities of the devices. The morphologies of the polymer films were analyzed through AFM using a VEECO DICP-II instrument operated in the tapping mode at ambient temperature; the etched Si probe exhibited a resonant frequency of 131 kHz and a spring constant of 11 N m\u22121. The stability of the devices was tested while the samples were placed inside the glove box. We used an OSRM halogen lamp [HAL PRO CL B 30 W 230 V E14] as light source; the intensity of light irradiated on devices was set at 2000 lux.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Cl,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: Unknown,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Al,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: TRUE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: 23.0; 23.0,\n Stability_atmosphere: Air,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: 1000,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: 8,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: 100,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Perovskite absorber material: 15\u2009g formamidine acetate and 30\u2009mL HI (57\u2009wt% in water) were dissolved in 100\u2009mL ethanol at 0\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h with stirring to obtain HC(NH2)2I. A solution of HC(NH2)2I was dried using rotary evaporator at 50\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. Following recrystallization from ethanol, white crystals were washed with diethyl ether. To synthesize CH3NH3Br, 11\u2009mL methylamine (33\u2009wt% in water) and 10\u2009mL HBr (48\u2009wt% in water) were mixed in 100\u2009mL ethanol at 0\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h with stirring.

Materials used in this work were purchased from Alfa Aesar or Lumtec or Sigma-Aldrich and were not purified.\n\nTo fabricated mesoporous solar cell for the experimental work, firstly, a compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was deposited by spray pyrolysis (~\u200950\u2009nm) using 20\u2009mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 450\u2009\u00b0C on the clean FTO glass (TEC8).

The deposited substrates were heated at 100\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min followed by sintering at 500\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The prepared perovskite solution was spun at 2000\u2009rpm (acceleration of 200\u2009rpm\u2009s-1) and 6000\u2009rpm (acceleration of 2000\u2009rpm\u2009s-1) for 10\u2009s and 30\u2009s. The anti-solvent chlorobenzene was drop-casted (110\u2009mL) during the last 20\u2009s of the second spin-coating step. The coated perovskite film was dried on a hot plate at 100\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. For the deposition of hole transport layer, a solution containing 41.6\u2009mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 7.5\u2009\u00b5L of a 500\u2009mg/mL lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl)-imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile and 16.9\u2009\u00b5L of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 0.5\u2009mL chlorobenzene was spin-coated respectively on the perovskite/m-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 2000\u2009rpm (acceleration of 1200\u2009rpm\u2009s-1) for 20\u2009s. Alternatively a solution containing 15\u2009mg of PTAA, 15\u2009\u00b5L of a 170\u2009mg/1\u2009mL Li-TFSI in acetonitrile and 7.5\u2009\u00b5L of tBP in 1.5\u2009mL toluene was deposited using the same conditions. All films on m-TiO2 were prepared in nitrogen filled glovebox. Finally, 100\u2009nm of gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.\n\nTwo kinds of ALD processes were employed in this work: 1) thermal ALD (Th-ALD), and plasma ALD (Pl-ALD). Th-ALD used Trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O (Classic, CN1, South Korea), and Pl-ALD employed TMA and O2 plasma as precursors (Lucida M200-PL, NCD, South Korea). Th-ALD procedure consists of 4 steps: (1) TMA was pulsed into reaction chamber for 0.1\u2009s using N2 gas with 500 sccm after sample loading, (2) Excess TMA and methane reaction products were purged by N2 for 5\u2009s with 500 sccm, (3) Water vapor was pulsed into reaction chamber for 0.1\u2009s by N2 with 500 sccm, Finally (4) N2 was purged to remove excess water vapor for 5\u2009s with 500 sccm. For the Pl-ALD process, the procedure is similar to that of Th-ALD. Pl-ALD process consists of 4 steps: (1) TMA was injected and pulsed into reaction chamber for 0.2\u2009s using Ar gas with 100 sccm after sample loading, (2) Excess TMA precursor was purged by Ar for 15\u2009s with 300 sccm, (3) O2 reactant was injected for 2\u2009s by Ar with 200 sccm and O2 plasma was generated with 100\u2009W of RF power and Ar gas which was charge of improving generation of plasma were introduced for 3\u2009s with 100 sccm, (4) Excess reactant was purged by Ar for 15 with 300 sccm. To investigate the effect of temperature on PSCs, three Th-ALD operating temperatures at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 105\u2009\u00b0C, 120\u2009\u00b0C to deposit 50\u2009nm of Al2O3 in the study. Once the desired temperature is chosen, e.g., at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 50\u2009nm thick Al2O3 were fabricated on PEN films using the two different ALD processes for the measurement of WVTR. The WVTR values were measured with AQUATRON Model 2 (Mocon Co., USA).\n\nThe J\u2013V measurements were performed using a solar cell I\u2013V testing system (LAB 200, McScence, Korea) under illumination power of 100\u2009mW/cm2 by an AM1.5\u2009G solar simulator (Oriel model 94023A) with 0.159\u2009cm2 aperture and a scan rate of 1.2\u2009V/s. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a XRD-6100 (SHIMADZU, JAPAN) with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb\u2009=\u20090.1541\u2009nm) at 30\u2009kV and 30\u2009mA. Reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) were measured using a Varian Cary UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR spectrophotometer in the 300\u2013900\u2009nm wavelength range. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (ESEM\u2013FEG XL30, FEI, Holland) was employed to investigate the effect of thermal stress on the morphology and structure of the perovskite. To carry out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, samples mounted on Cu girds were prepared using Focused Ion beam. The prepared sample was measured with JEM-2100F (JEOL LTD) at operating 200\u2009kV equipped with EDS (TEM 250, Oxford Instruments). Stability tests were carried out in two kinds of conditions. These include: (a) 65\u2009\u00b0C-85%RH (SE-CT-02, SUKSAN Tech.

The substrates were thoroughly cleaned with a detergent solution, acetone, and isopropanol, and finally treated in a plasma cleaner for 5 min.

Then an appropriate amount of CsI (1.5 M in DMSO) was added to the FA/MA/GA solution for the target quadruple cation based CsFAMA1\u2212xGAx perovskite precursor. Before use, all perovskite precursors were stirred at room temperature for 3 hours in a glove box and filtered with a 0.45 \u03bcm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter.\nThen, 60 \u03bcL of the prepared perovskite precursor was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 600 rpm for 5 s and then at 4000 rpm for 40 s. During the second procedure, 150 \u03bcL of toluene was dropped on the spinning substrate 15 s before the program ended. The resulting films were transferred to a hot plate at 120 \u00b0C and dried for 15 min.

The UV-vis absorption and XRD of the films were measured every 7 days. The J\u2013V curves of the devices were recorded every day. Thermal stability was studied by exposing the devices to the ambient environment of 80 \u00b0C and 40% humidity and measuring the J\u2013V curves every day. For light-soaking stability test, unencapsulated devices were exposed to continuous 1 sun illumination generated by an LED lamp without UV light. The J\u2013V curves of the devices were recorded every 5 or 10 min.

Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301pc with an excitation wavelength of 523 nm. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7100F) was used to study the surface and cross-section morphology. Grazing incident XRD (GIXRD) patterns were obtained by using a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with the incidence angle ranging from 0.5\u00b0 to 7\u00b0. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured under a constant white light supplied by an array of white-light emitting diodes. The excitation beam from a 300 W xenon lamp was focused through a double-monochromator and chopped at 10 Hz. The monochromatic light intensity for the measurement was calibrated using a reference silicon photodiode. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured using a PL system (DW-PLE03). TGA analysis was conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC 1 STARe System).

Subsequently, the precursor solutions were spin-coated at 4,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s on appropriate substrates. At 7\u00a0s after the start of the spin-coating step, 0.6\u00a0mL of chlorobenzene was quickly dripped. The spin-coated thin films were then annealed at 130\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.\n\nXRD patterns were obtained under Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u00a0= 0.15406\u00a0nm) with a step size of 0.02\u00b0 on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-advance, Karlsruhe, Germany). The surface morphology of the thin films was characterized by SEM (LEO 1530VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The local roughness of the thin films was characterized by AFM (MFP-3D Origin, Asylum Research, USA) with a silicon probe. Conductive AFM measurements were made with the same instrument in contact mode with a conducting platinum-coated silicon probe (Econo-SCM-PIC, Asylum Research, USA). UV-vis spectra were obtained with a spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (ISR-2600, Shimadzu, Japan). A standard BaSO4 pellet (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was used as the reference. UV-vis spectra of the solutions were obtained with the same spectrophotometer without the integrating sphere attachment.

Charge extraction measurements were performed using an Autolab Potentiostat-Galvanostat (PGSTAT) with a FRA32M LED driver equipped with a white light source. The cells were illuminated from the substrate side. The Nova 1.11 software program was used to collect and analyze the obtained data. A typical charge extraction experiment consisted of (1) a two-second step in which the cell is discharged in the dark. (2) The cell is then disconnected and illuminated for 2 seconds (illumination time). (3) The light is then switched off and the system waits for a certain time called the delay time. In this step, a charge is recombined inside the cell. (4) The cell is then reconnected and the charges that were left and did not recombine are extracted and measured. This process is repeated for different delay times, ranging from 0.5 seconds to 15 seconds. The charges collected are plotted against the delay time to give insight into the life-span of the charges after a certain delay time.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: TiCl4,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbBr3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbBr,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: BA,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMSO; GBL,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: FK209; Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.04,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "By changing the reaction conditions from sonication at room temperature to reflux, the formation ratio of the \u03b1-DMEC70 with respect to the other two isomers (Fig. 1a) was improved from 82% to 90% (Scheme S1\u2020).

Device fabrication was completed through thermal evaporation of a 100 nm-thick film of Ag as the cathode under high vacuum (pressure: ca. 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar). During the thermal evaporation process, a shadow mask was used to define a device area of 0.1 cm2.\n\nCurrent density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit.

The NIR laser pulse was split into two NIR pulses, with a power ratio of 10:1, using a beam splitter. The higher-intensity NIR pulse was focused into a \u03b2-barium borate crystal for second harmonic (SH) generation; the generated SH laser pulse was guided to a delay stage for retro reflection, and then focused onto the sample as a pump pulse. The lower-intensity NIR pulse (pulse energy: 5 \u03bcJ) was focused onto a sapphire plate (thickness: 2 mm) to generate a white light continuum (WLC); the WLC pulse was focused onto the sample as a WLC probe pulse. Using a parabolic mirror, both the pump (400 nm) and WLC probe (500\u2013750 nm) pulses were focused onto the sample. A charge-coupled device camera (Series 2000, Entwicklungsburo Stresing), connected through an optical fiber and polychromator (CP140, Yobin Yvon), recorded the probe pulse transmitted through the sample. For measurements of the change in absorption with and without sample excitation, the pump frequency was modulated with an optical chopper running at 2.5 kHz. The difference absorption spectrum (\u0394A) of the sample at each time delay between the pump and probe pulses was acquired using LabVIEW software. The delay was scanned using a delay stage inserted in the optical path of the pump pulses.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Bphen,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Cl,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 90,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 50,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PEDOT:PSS,\n HTL_additives_compounds: MoS2,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Urea and thiourea were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.

The CsPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving an equimolar ratio of PbI2 (0.8 M) and CsI (0.8 M) in a mixed solvent of (4:1) DMF:DMSO. The precursor solution was magnetically stirred overnight at 60 \u00b0C and the CsBr solutions were prepared by dissolving 5, 10, or 15 mg of CsBr in methanol. Note that a concentration of CsBr greater than 15 mg was found to be insoluble in methanol at room temperature (see Fig. S1 in the ESI\u2020). Therefore, we prepared a CsBr/methanol solution with a maximum of 15 mg of CsBr per 1 mL of methanol. A hole transport layer (HTL) was created by dissolving 10 mg of P3HT in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and stirring the solution overnight at room temperature. The P3HT solution was filtered before use. SnO2 was used as an electron transport layer (ETL) and was prepared as described in a previous report. Briefly, the SnO2 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving an SnO2 (450 \u03bcL) colloid dispersion and an LiCl (300 \u03bcL) aqueous solution (17 mg/4 mL) in 1.7 mL of deionized water (DI) water while stirring at room temperature for four hours.\n\nPlanar inorganic PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI3 or CsPbI3\u2212xBrx/P3HT/Au.

After cleaning and drying, the substrates were treated with ozone (O3) plasma for 20 min to increase their surface wettability. The ETL was obtained by spin-coating an SnO2 precursor onto the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s in ambient air and annealing for 170 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox with air and H2O content >1 ppm for coating with the CsPbI3 perovskite layer. The CsPbI3 perovskite solution was filtered with a PVDF (0.45 \u03bcM) filter, spin-coated onto the SnO2 layer at 2000 rpm for 45 s, and then dried for 50 min at room temperature.

The surface and cross-sectional morphologies and the elemental mapping of the prepared films and devices were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; SIGMA, Carl Zeiss). The absorption spectra of the planar perovskite films were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (UV-2700; Shimadzu). Steady-state PL measurements of the fabricated perovskite films were conducted using a spectrofluorometer (FP-8600, Jasco) with a laser excitation wavelength of 405 nm.

TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized following a previously reported method. In a typical synthesis 2 ml of anhydrous TiCl4 (99.9%) was added dropwise while stirring into a vial containing 8 ml of anhydrous ethanol. The whole content was transferred into a 100 ml flask containing 40 ml anhydrous benzyl alcohol. The solution was heated to 80 \u00b0C and reacted for 9 hours. After that time the reaction was stopped by cooling down the solution, which contained a translucent dispersion of very fine TiO2 nanoparticles. Then, 4 ml of the above solution was mixed with 36 ml of diethyl ether resulting in the precipitation of the TiO2. The precipitate was centrifuged, washed with acetone and redispersed in anhydrous ethanol, resulting in a colloidal solution of approximately 28 mg TiO2/ml ethanol (3.54 wt% of TiO2). The formulation was further diluted 3 times (1.18 wt% of TiO2) in anhydrous ethanol and the appropriate amount of TiAcAc (10\u201320 mol% with respect to the TiO2 content) was added directly. The solution was left to stand for at least 2 hours before use, but is stable for months. The low temperature TiO2 compact layer (lt-TiO2) was prepared by spin-coating the colloidal dispersion of anatase particles in anhydrous ethanol, formulated with TiAcAc, followed by drying at 150 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. The thickness of the compact layer was tuned by the concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles (3.54\u20130.24 wt% TiO2 to ethanol). As standard control samples, blocking layers of non-crystalline TiOx and high temperature processed TiO2 (ht-TiO2) were used. The former was prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution (titanium isopropoxide, TTIP) in anhydrous ethanol (0.254 M) with the addition of 0.02 M HCl followed by annealing at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min, the latter was prepared by spin-coating the same solution (TTIP), followed by annealing at 150 \u00b0C and sintering at 500 \u00b0C.\nPhotovoltaic devices were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (Pilkington, TEC7). Substrates were cleaned in hallmanex, and then subjected to 10 minutes sonication in acetone, 10 minutes sonication in IPA, and 10 minutes of oxygen plasma etching. Compact layers were deposited by spin-coating, as described above. An alumina scaffold was deposited according to the previously reported method which employs Al2O3 nanoparticles of diameter <50 nm. After depositing the alumina scaffold samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox, initially optimised precursor solution of the concentration of 350 mg ml\u22121 (CH3NH3I and PbCl2, 3:1 molar ratio in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) was spin-coated at room temperature, followed by annealing at 100 \u00b0C for 90 minutes. The concentration of the precursor solution was re-optimised to 400 mg ml\u22121, resulting in an increased perovskite film thickness. The hole transporter was deposited by spin-coating an 8 wt% 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) in chlorobenzene with added tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) of 80 and 30 mol%, with respect to spiro-OMeTAD.

Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4300 microscope. Conductivity measurements of TiO2 films were performed by evaporating gold electrodes through the shadow mask on the spin-coated compact layers and using a 4-point probe set up with a Keithley 2400 as a sourcemeter. The electrode pattern was designed for 4-point probe measurements with an outer probe channel dimensions of 1 mm (length) \u00d7 1 cm (width) and an inner probe separation of 300 \u03bcm. The thickness of the channel (TiO2 layer) was determined from the SEM cross-sectional image. X-ray diffraction spectra were obtained for powder samples (the nanoparticle solution was dried in air at 150 \u00b0C) using a Panalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer.\nCurrent\u2013voltage characteristics of solar cells were measured under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm2 sunlight (ABET Technologies Sun 2000) with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The lamp was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated KG5 filtered silicon reference with a solar mismatch factor of 1.01. The active area of the device was defined by a metal mask with a square aperture of an area of 0.0625 cm2. The pre-masked active area of the solar cells was approximately 0.12 cm2 nominally defined by the overlap area of the silver and FTO electrodes.

A \u223c40nm thick blocking layer of TiO2 (Bl-TiO2) was deposited on the substrates by spin coating of 0.15 M and 0.3 M commercial titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, volume ratio) as a precursor. Subsequently it was annealed in air at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min. The TiO2 nanorods were deposited directly onto the FTO substrate using a technique reported elsewhere. Briefly, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was hydrolyzed in equal volumes of HCl:H2O at 180 \u00b0C for 3 h. The films were washed several times with water/ethanol and used for further processes. The as-prepared, rutile TiO2 nanorod-coated FTO sample was further used for a secondary hydrothermal process (etching). In a typical experiment, nanorod-coated FTO substrates were immersed in an acidic solution of HCl:H2O (2:1 v:v%) and maintained at 150 \u00b0C. The etching time was varied from 0 h (as deposited), 3.0 h, 3.5 h and 4.0 h. After completion of the etching process, the etched TiO2 nanorods were rinsed extensively with de-ionized water and dried in air. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated with a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 \u00b0C, rinsed with de-ionized water and dried at 500 \u00b0C for 20 min.\n\nTo synthesise the TiO2 nanoflowers, titanium(IV) butoxide was hydrolyzed in an equal volume of concentrated HCl (37% Sigma Aldrich) at 180 \u00b0C for 3 h. After TiO2 nanoflower synthesis, the samples were etched as per the method described above (for 0 h, 3.0 h, 3.5 h and 4.0 h) and used for TiCl4 treatment and then dried at 500 \u00b0C for 20 min. Please note that fresh hydrothermal and TiCl4 treatment solutions were prepared before each experiment.\nThe length, diameter, density and nanostructure of the TiO2 nanorods were optimized via solution concentration and etching time. The amount of TiO2 precursor (TTIP or TBT) was varied from 100 \u03bcl to 240 \u03bcl and the etching time was varied from 3 h to 4 h at 150 \u00b0C, for optimization of efficiency.

Briefly, hydroiodic acid was added dropwise to a solution of methyl-amine (aqueous, 40 wt%, TCI Chemicals) in an ice bath, and then stirred for 2 h, before the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The resulting white solid product was dried under vacuum overnight at 50 \u00b0C. The MAPbI3 solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of MAI and lead iodide (PbI2) in anhydrous \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL). The clear, filtered yellow solution was spin coated on top of the 1D or 3D TiO2 samples followed by heat treatment on a hot plate for 10 min to form dark-brown crystalline MAPbI3.\n\nFor the MAPbI3\u2212xClx perovskite layer, the desired amount of MAI powder was mixed with PbI2/PbCl2 in a GBL/DMF (3:1 v/v) binary solvent and stirred at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h. Furthermore, the formamidinium NH2CHNH2I (FAI) was first synthesized by reacting hydroiodic acid and formamidine acetate.

The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 substrate was coated with a HTM solution, using the spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar. For the Au counter-electrode, 80 nm thick Au contacts were deposited on the top of the HTM overlayer by thermal evaporation (growth rate of \u223c0.5 \u00c5 s\u22121) at a pressure of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar.

The resulting solution was filtered using a 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE membrane filter prior to spin coating at 2000 rpm. The obtained ZnO films were annealed at 200 \u00b0C for 1 hour in air. Precursor cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9% from Aldrich) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9% from Aldrich) were thermally co-evaporated in a vacuum chamber integrated inside an MBraun glove box (4 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar) at the balanced deposition rates of 0.5\u20132 \u00c5 s\u22121, producing CsxPbI2Brx films with x ranging from 0.95 to 4 and total thickness of 150 \u00b1 10 nm. The thermal evaporation sources were carefully calibrated to achieve high accuracy and reproducibility in the thickness of the deposited films. Sequential layer-by-layer deposition of CsBr and PbI2 with the balanced layer thicknesses provided the required composition of the perovskite films. Composition of the films was additionally verified using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (see Table S1, ESI\u2020). The freshly grown CsxPbI2Brx films were annealed at 270 \u00b0C for 10 min in a nitrogen atmosphere inside the glove box. A P3HT hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating (15 mg ml\u22121 in chlorobenzene) at 1200 rpm for 50 s.

After recrystallization for 3 times, the white powder was dried at room temperature under vacuum for 2 days to afford the desired pure MABr.\nThe mixed-cation perovskite precursor solution of (FAPbI3)1\u2212x(MAPbBr3)x (x = 0.15) was prepared in a glovebox, by dissolving the FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in a mixed solvent of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1, v/v), as reported previously.\n\nFluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (Pilkington TEC 15) was firstly patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl. The etched substrate was then sequentially cleaned by using detergent, de-ionized water and ethanol. Remaining organic residues were removed under oxygen plasma for 30 min. A compact TiO2 blocking layer (BL) of roughly 30\u201340 nm was deposited on the cleaned FTO glasses by spray pyrolysis of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) diluted in anhydrous ethanol at a volumetric ratio of 1:10 and then heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) diluted in anhydrous ethanol at ratio of 1:5 by weight at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The layers were then sintered in air at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixed-cation perovskite films were deposited onto the mesoporous TiO2/BL TiO2/FTO substrates from the precursor solution by a two-step spin-coating procedure, at 1000 rpm for 30 s and then 5000 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 200 \u03bcl of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrates 10 s prior to the end of the program. The substrate was directly heated on a hotplate at 100 \u00b0C for 60 min. After cooling to room temperature, different doping level of P3HT:F4TCNQ composites were deposited on the perovskite layers at 2000 rpm for 30 min via solution process. 20 mg ml\u22121 P3HT solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg P3HT in 1 ml ortho-dichlorobenzene (DCB), stirred at 70 \u00b0C for 30 min. p-Type doping material F4TCNQ in DCB solution with a concentration of 2 mg ml\u22121 was also stirred at 70 \u00b0C for 30 min before adding to the P3HT solution. In addition, for comparison, 9.1 \u03bcl of a stock solution of 28.5 mg ml\u22121 LiTFSI in acetonitrile (ACN) and 4.5 \u03bcl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was mixed into 1 ml P3HT (20 mg) solution as HTM solution.

A black mask with a circular aperture (0.09 cm2) smaller than the active area of the square solar cell (0.20 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The J\u2013V curves were obtained from forward bias to short-circuit at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by Oriel IQE 200 (Newport USA, Model: 94023A/PVIV-212V/IQE-AC-QTH-SI-220). Prior to measurement, a standard silicon solar cell was used as reference.\n\nThe top view and cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by HR-SEM performed with FEI (Field Emission Instruments: Nova Nano SEM 450), the USA. Conductivity measurements were performed as follows. Glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by detergent, de-ionised water and ethanol. Remaining organic residues were removed under oxygen plasma for 30 min. A thin layer of compact TiO2 (\u223c30 nm) was coated on the glass substrates. After sintering the TiO2 film at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min, the film was cooled to room temperature. A solution of HTM in DCB was spin-coated onto the TiO2 substrate, whereas the concentration was the same as in case for the photovoltaic device. Finally, a 200 nm-thick of Ag was deposited on the top of the HTM by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa). A two-point probe setup was used with a Keithley 2400 source meter for measuring linear current\u2013voltage curves.

The MAxFA1\u2212xPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2, MAI, FAI and MACl (1:0.4:0.6:1.2, molar ratio, x = 0.4) in DMF. The 0.73 M FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2, FAI and MACl (1:1:1, molar ratio) in DMF. The perovskite solutions were spin-coated on the substrates at 2500 rpm for 40 s, then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 60 min for MAPbI3 and MA0.4FA0.6PbI3 perovskite films, while at 120 \u00b0C for 60 min for the FAPbI3 perovskite film. After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the hole transport layer (HTL) was coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The HTL solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 \u03bcL of 520 mg mL\u22121 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile and 28.8 \u03bcL of 300 mg mL\u22121 tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile were added. Finally, an 80 nm-thick Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received.\n\nThe morphologies of the perovskite films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and were determined at 200 kV using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010). The perovskite samples were dispersed in chloroform and dropped onto the surface of a copper grid.

UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was carried out by using an Edinburgh FLS980 spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 510 nm with irradiation from the side of spin-coated materials. TRPL was performed using a picosecond diode laser (EPL-470, 95 ps) and the signal was recorded at 775 nm (MAPbI3), 795 nm (MA0.4FA0.6PbI3) and 810 nm (FAPbI3) after excitation at 475 nm. The measurement conditions were the same as the steady-state PL.\nThe current density (J)\u2013voltage (V) characteristics were obtained by exposing the targeted cells to a standardized sunlight simulator, which was calibrated by a standard silicon reference cell to AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm\u22122), with sweeping over of the predetermined applied bias voltage range from open circuit to short circuit (reverse scan) at a scan rate of 1 mV s\u22121 without light soaking or voltage treatment history. A metal aperture mask was used to fix the active area to 0.1 cm2, and all data were acquired by a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter.\n\nTPV measurements were conducted following a previous report. The targeted cell was kept under open-circuit conditions and was irradiated by a continuous-wave LED laser (520 nm, RGB photonics, Lambda beam) to maintain a steady-state photovoltage (Vph). Then weak laser pulses (532 nm, 7 ns) were applied to induce a small increase (\u0394Vph) in Vph, with \u0394Vph/Vph \u2264 5%. Finally, electric signals were recorded on a digital oscilloscope (64Xs, Lecroy; Input impendence, 1 M\u03a9). A series of desired Vph was obtained by adjusting the intensity of the LED laser through laser power and neutral filters.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Cl,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Methylamine solution (40 wt% in ethanol), hydriodic acid (57 wt% in H2O) and lead (II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) were purchased from Alfa or Sigma-Aldrich.

The suspension was stirred for 5 min, filtered and the residue washed with CH2Cl2 (30 mL). The filtrates were combined and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The crude product was purified by column chromatography with CH2Cl2/ethanol (v/v, 1/3) as the eluent to give a blue product. The product was further purified by repeated recrystallization from CH2Cl2/ethanol to give CuBuPc (0.38 g, 35%).

Briefly, in the first step, 5 g of graphite flakes (99.95%), 3 g of K2S2O8 and 3 g of P2O5 were dissolved in 20 mL concentrated H2SO4 (95 wt.%) and stirred at 80 \u00b0C for about 8 h. The resultant mixture was then diluted with 1 L deionized water and filtered using a porous membrane (0.45 micron). Washing procedure was carried out until achieving neutral pH. The pre-oxidized graphite flakes were obtained by drying the final product at 40 \u00b0C overnight. In a second step, the above oxidized graphite powder was added into 100 mL concentrated H2SO4 (95 wt.%) in an ice bath (0 \u00b0C) and were stirred until dissolution. 12 g of KMnO4 and 4 g of NaNO3 were then added gradually and successively into the mixture, controlling its temperature around 20 \u00b0C. The cooling bath was then removed and the solution was transferred to a 35 \u00b0C water bath for gas releasing under continuous stirring for about 1 h to obtain a thick green paste. Afterwards, 180 mL of deionized water was slowly added into the paste, causing violent effervescence and an increase of temperature up to 98 \u00b0C. The temperature of the diluted dark brown mixture was kept constant at 98 \u00b0C for 20 min with vigorous stirring in order to increase the oxidation degree of the GO product. Then 300 ml of warm deionized water was added to further dilute the mixture, which was treated with 30 mL of 30% H2O2, drop by drop within 10 min, in order to reduce the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide to colorless soluble manganese sulfate. The color of the final solution turned to yellow-pale brown. To eliminate the residual metal ions, the filtered cake was washed and filtered four times with warm deionized water and a 10% HCl solution in ethanol and water until the pH reached a neutral level (ca. 6.4). The product was further diluted to approximately 400 mL with deionized water and ultrasonicated at boost mode for 40 min. The yellow-brown GO dispersion was then subjected to dialysis to completely remove metal ions and acids. Finally, it was dehydrated in an air oven at 40 \u00b0C for 14 h to yield the GO powder. 10 mg of the GO powder was added in 2 mL isopropanol alcohol, then placed in an ultrasonic water bath for 1 h to ensure good exfoliation.\n\nA colloidal dispersion of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles [<50 nm particle size (DLS), 20 wt. % in isopropanol] has been used. It was further diluted by sonicating 200 \u03bcL of this colloidal dispersion in 2 mL isopropanol.\n\nFTO-coated glass substrates were cut in pieces of dimensions 1 cm \u00d7 3 cm. One third of the conductive layer was removed using zinc powder and hydrochloric acid. Then they were washed with mild detergent, rinsed several times with distilled water and subsequently with ethanol and acetone in an ultrasonic bath, finally dried under air stream. A compact thin layer of TiO2 was then deposited on this patterned and cleaned FTO electrode by aerosol spray pyrolysis using a solution of 0.2 M Diisopropoxytitanium bis(acetylacetonate) in EtOH. After spraying, the samples were heated for 1 hour at 500 \u00b0C. Subsequently, a mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of titania paste made of P25 nanoparticles was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 seconds and then dried at 100 \u00b0C for 20 min and calcined for 30 minutes at 500 \u00b0C. After that the samples were treated in TiCl4 by dipping into a solution made of 0.04 M TiCl4 in H2O for 30 minutes at 70 \u00b0C, then copiously rinsing and finally calcining at 500\u00b0 C. Active perovskite layer was deposited on the thus prepared titania film by the following procedure. A precursor solution was made by mixing 253 mg PbCl2 and 507 mg PbI2 with 270 mg methyl ammonium iodide in a mixture of 1 ml N-N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 0.5 ml dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The solution was kept under stirring for about 2 hours at about 80 \u00b0C and then deposited by two consecutive spin-coating steps; first 1000 rpm for 10 s, then 6000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 1 mL chlorobenzene, as an anti-solvent, was gently dropped on the spinning substrate. The layer was then heated at 90 \u00b0C for about 45 min, which made the sample\u2019s color turn from yellow to black. Thereafter, thin mesoporous buffer layers were spin-coated directly on the annealed perovskite layer at room temperature. Both Al2O3 and GO layers were deposited at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The hole transporting material (HTM) was then deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 60s. The HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving 36 mg of HTM powders (spiro-OMeTAD or CuBuPc) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. In these solutions we added 28.8 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 17.5 \u03bcL of a stock solution of Lithium bis (trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile (520 mg/1 mL). All of these procedures were carried out under ambient conditions of 50\u201360% relative humidity. The last step for preparing the solid state solar cell was the deposition of 90 nm thick gold electrodes by thermal evaporation under vacuum. The thickness of the subsequent layers forming the solar cells can be seen in the FESEM cross-sectional image of Fig. 1 . These unit devices had an active size of 15 mm2 (10 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm) as defined by the size of the gold electrodes.\n\nIllumination of the solar cells was made with a PECCELL PEC-L01 Solar Simulator set at 100 mW/cm2, through a mask of aperture size 1 \u00d7 6 mm2. J\u2212V characteristic curves were recorded under ambient conditions with a Keithley 2601 source meter that was controlled by Keithley computer software (LabTracer). IPCE values were obtained with an Oriel IQE 200 system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). Absorption and photoluminescence spectra using thin transparent perovskite films were recorded with a Cary 1E UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer and a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. FESEM/EDX measurements were made using a Zeiss SUPRA 35VP with a field emission gun equipped with an EDX system (QUANTA 200, Bruker AXS).

The melting point was conducted on a SGW-X-4B microscopic melting point apparatus. HRMS spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 1290 Infinity mass spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Sirion200, Holland Fei) was performed to observe the film morphology. Time-resolved luminescence decays were recorded with time-correlated single photo counting system (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant GmbH). The excitation light source was Ti:Sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent; 76\u202fMHz, 130\u202ffs). UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of molecules were measured on Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The emission spectra of the molecules in THF solution were performed on a Fluorolog III photoluminescence. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were recorded on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a typical three electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dry MeCN with a scan rate of 50\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple acted as an internal potential reference.\n\nThe patterned ITO coated glass was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent water, deionized water, acetone and ethanol continuously. The substrate was treated with UV-O3 for 20\u202fmin. In brief, a 50\u202fnm-thick compact TiO2 layer was deposited onto the ITO substrate with 3000\u202frpm twice followed by 150\u202f\u00b0C annealing 30\u202fmin. After cooling to room temperature, CH3NH3PbI3Cl3-x film was prepared via a modified two-step solution process , where PbI2 (450\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 dissolved in dimethyl formamide) was spin-coated on top of electron transporting layer (ETL) at 2500\u202frpm for 30\u202fs and CH3NH3I (50\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 with CH3NH3Cl of 10:1 in weight ratio comparing to CH3NH3I dissolved in 2-propanol) was spin coated on top of the dried PbI2 layer at room temperature at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. The films were annealed at 135\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u20135\u202fmin. A HTL was coated on the perovskite film at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs.

All other organic solvents were obtained as analytical grade from J&K Chemical Ltd. with storage in seal bottle with molecular sieves.\n\n\u03b2-NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs were synthesized according to the method reported in the literature . Typically, CF3COONa, Y(CF3COO)3, Yb(CF3COO)3, and Er(CF3COO)3 were synthesized by dissolving Na2CO3, Y2O3, Yb2O3, and Er2O3 in 50\u00a0vol% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution with reflux at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h.

After naturally cooled to 80\u00a0\u00b0C, the UCNCs was obtained by centrifugation, rinsing with ethanol, and finally dispersed in 10\u00a0mL n-hexane for further uses.\n\nOAm ligands on the UCNCs surface were removed using a NOBF4-mediated ligand-exchange approach . Typically, n-hexane solution of OAm-UCNCs (20\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121) was mixed anhydrous DMF solution of NOBF4, and then shaken gently for 10\u00a0min to get rid of OAm ligands. The BF4 \u2212-capped UCNCs was collected from the export of the separatory funnel and then re-dispersed in DMF.

The NIR response of the PSC devices were tested under AM 1.5G sunlight with a 780\u00a0nm high-pass optical filter on the light path. EQE was acquired by an Oriel model QE-PV-SI system equipped an irradiation of 300\u00a0W Xe lamp together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. Steady state PL spectra (SS-PL) was characterized at 775\u00a0nm after excited at 470\u00a0nm with a Xenon lamp. Time-resolved PL spectra (TR-PL) was measured on PL spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser CW NIR laser at 460\u00a0nm as the excitation source and measured at 775\u00a0nm. The TR-PL decay curves were fitted with a tri-exponential function as PL intensity\u00a0=\u00a0A\u00a0+\u00a0\u03a3Biexp (\u2212t/\u03c4i), and the relative content (Ai) of each time constant \u03c4 was calculated by Ai\u00a0=\u00a0Bi\u03c4i/(\u03a3Bi\u03c4i).

After complete dissolution and the formation of a transparent yellow solution, 0.25\u202fmL di-iodomethane was pipetted to the solution and stirred for 2\u202f hours to provide the complete dissolution. During the spinning process, a dry air stream was put in the spin coater chamber to keep the relative humidity less than 10%. After heating the wet perovskite film for 20 \u202fseconds on a hotplate at 110\u202f\u00b0C, the slides were immediately taken to the IPL machine to perform rapid perovskite annealing through 5 pulses, each with 1.4\u202fkJ energy. For flexible substrates, the wet film coated sheets were placed on a hotplate at 75\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fs to form a dark brown film and were subsequently sintered through a single IPL shot with 900\u202fJ energy, an optimal condition where perovskite film damage was observed at higher energy quantities. Both hotplate and IPL annealing steps were carried out in the ambient with relative humidity of 60%. Right after perovskite annealing, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen filled glovebox for the Spiro-MeOTAD hole-transport layer deposition.

Later, a 17.5\u202f\u03bcL of a stock solution of 520 \u202fmg/mL lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide in anhydrous acetonitrile was pipetted to the solution and stirred until full dissolution. Finally, 29\u202f\u03bcL of the cobalt dopant FK209 TFSI salt (300\u202f mg/mL in anhydrous acetonitrile) was pipetted to the mixture to prepare the final solution. The Spiro-MeOTAD film was made by spin-coating 70\u202f\u03bcL of the prepared solution at 1700 \u202frpm for 30 \u202fseconds.

IPL annealing was done through a Xenon S-2000 rack-mounted sintering system with linear Xenon flash lamp placed within 5.7\u202fcm from the substrates. Surface morphology inspections were done through a FEI Nova NanoSEM 600 SEM machine with an accelerating voltage of 10\u202fkV and a working distance of 5\u202fmm.

These included a range of 10 LDS materials, from metal complexes to organic dyes. The relevant aspects to considering the LDS application of the materials were their optical properties, processability, commercial availability and cheapness. The material selected for this work was Kremer fluorescent blue (KB), which is based upon a Triazine-toluene sulfonamide-paraformaldehyde-based resin. The LDS material was dissolved with PMMA into anisole at a concentration of 8% by weight. The layers were deposited by spin coating onto the top facing side of a fused silica substrates and annealed for 15\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The average film thickness was measured to be 300\u00a0nm. Table\u00a01 shows the values for the figures of merit (FOM) calculated for PMMA:KB films. The detailed definition of the parameters listed in Table\u00a01 was given in a previous work .\nThe calculations of the FOMs were based on absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PMMA:KB layer, and on the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) curve of the perovskite-based device, as shown in Fig.\u00a01 . PL was measured with a Horiba Scientific Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 375\u00a0nm (at the maximum of optical absorption of the layer). EQE spectra were recorded using a Bentham TMC300 monochromator, with measurements taken every 1\u00a0nm using a Stanford Research System SR830 lock-in amplifier. As seen in Fig.\u00a01, the optical absorption of the PMMA:KB layer is between 350 and 420\u00a0nm, so this should prevent any UV light in this region entering the absorber layer.\nFor control, a UV filter was supplied from Solaronix (Switzerland), which cuts off light with wavelengths less than 390\u00a0nm.\n\nMethylammonium Iodide (MAI, code 14965-49-2) and Lead (II) Chloride (PbCl2, code 7758-95-4) were purchased from Lumtec (Taiwan) with 99.999% purity.

Absorbance measurements were taken every 10\u00a0min.\nThe PSC current density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured for six devices illuminated by the same solar simulator. For this work, three configurations were used whereby the light facing side of the device was covered with a UV filter, PMMA:KB LDS layer or without filtration. For stability tests, the devices were constantly light soaked illumination interrupted for the J-V measurements made every 5\u00a0min.

The setup is schematically shown in Fig. S1. To obtain the accurate deposition rate of MAI, the deposition rate of MAI can be quantified by the partial pressure of MAI [,,].

According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, the optimal perovskite deposition condition was a MAI partial pressure of 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125\u202fTorr and a PbI2 rate of 0.4\u202f\u202f\u00c5\u202fs\u22121 [].\n\nPSC devices were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (DSG, DHS-FTO22). Substrate preparation is the same as reported previously []. A 20\u202fnm thick TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the FTO substrate at 2500 r.p.m for 60\u202fs by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide (Sigma, 97%) in ethanol, and annealed in a muffle furnace at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air. Afterwards, the TiO2 coated substrate was transferred into a N2-filled glove box, where the PCBM layer was spin-coated from a PCBM precursor solution (10% in chlorobenzene) at 3000 r.p.m for 60\u202fs and subsequently dried at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. Three approaches were used to fabricate MAPbI3 perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 1 . Common co-evaporation was taken as a reference method, in which the perovskite films were simply deposited under the optimal growth condition. On the PCBM coated substrates, a 260\u202fnm thick perovskite layer was deposited for device A0. For devices A5, A10, A20, a PbI2 layer with a thickness of 5, 10, 20\u202fnm, respectively, was deposited with a PbI2 deposition rate of 0.4\u202f\u00c5\u202fs\u22121 prior to the growth of perovskite films. In SVHM (device B), prior to vacuum deposition of perovskite films, a 80\u202fnm thick perovskite layer was deposited in glove box by spin-coating from a homogeneous 10% wt.% CH3NH3PbIxCl3\u2212x precursor solution at 6000 r.p.m for 60\u202fs and followed by annealing at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 70\u202fmin.

After exposing to MAI atmosphere for certain times, perovskite films were deposited under optimal growth condition. After the deposition of perovskite films, a hole transport layer (HTL) was spin-coated at 3000 r.p.m for 60\u202fs in glovebox.

The samples used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were protected in a home-made N2-filled box for the least exposure to air to ensure that the samples did not deteriorate before the measurements. The XRD measurement was taken on a Rigaku D MAX-3C (Cu-Ka, \u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.54050\u202f\u00c5). The SEM measurement on the morphology of the perovskite films was taken on a JEOL JSM-6700F.

The TiO2 compact layer (C-TiO2) was first deposited by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in isopropanol (3000 rpm, 45 s) on the as-cleaned FTO substrates, then annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min.

All the solutions were prepared inside an argon filled glove box under controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (H2O level: <1 ppm and O2 level: <10 ppm).\n\nThe transmittance and reflectance spectra of the perovskite films were collected using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer. Current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were documented with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement-unit under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination from a 450 W AAA solar simulator (ORIEL, 94023 A). This was calibrated using a NREL certified calibrated mono-crystalline silicon solar cell. A black metal mask (0.16 cm2) was used over the square solar cell active area (0.5 cm2) to reduce the influence of scattered light.\nPhotovoltaic parameters including JSC, VOC, fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were extracted from the photocurrent\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves of the solar cells. The scan rate and the active surface area used for measuring the devices were optimized as such to calculate the real value for efficiencies without having a hysteresis effect. (Active surface area: 0.16 cm2, scan rate: 100 mV s\u22121, pre-sweep delay: 20 s). The IPCE measurements were performed using a Newport 150 W xenon lamp coupled to an Oriel Cornerstone 260 motorized \u00bc m monochromator as the light source, and a 2936-R power meter to measure the short circuit current.\nFor X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization, films were prepared by spin-coating the perovskites onto FTO glass. For XPS, an Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH system operating at a base pressure of \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u221211 Torr with a non-monochromatized Mg K\u03b1 line at 1253.6 eV was used. The acquired resolution of core levels was 0.1 eV measured at 90% of peak height and the spectra were acquired at 25 eV pass energy. The survey spectra were acquired with 100 eV pass energy, and the resolution is 1 eV. An EKF 300 ion source, operating at a pressure of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 mbar, was used for depth-profiling and sputtering and it was effected by an Ar+ ion beam energy of 0.5 kV. The target current was 59.3 \u03bcA, and the sputtering time was 5 min. The sputtering rates employed were small enough to remove the top layers. The core level spectra were deconvoluted using a non-linear iterative least squares Gaussian fitting procedure. For all fitting multiplets, the FWHMs were fixed accordingly. Corrections due to charging effects were taken care of by using C(1s) as an internal reference and the Fermi edge of a gold sample. The Jandel Peak FitTM (version 4.01) program was used for the analysis. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku powder diffractometer using a CuK\u03b1 source. The wavelength range of the UV lamp used was between 250 and 365 nm and the samples were kept in an ambient atmosphere (55\u201360% RH) in our lab. Absorption spectra were recorded for the perovskites by using an Agilent Carry 60 spectrophotometer. The ETM, absorber and HTM layer thicknesses were 150, 480 and 270 nm respectively.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: FA0.85MA0.15PbBr0.45I2.55,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: FAMAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: Unknown,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 60,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: FK209; Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.16,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.99%, LT-S9126) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp., PbI2 (99%) from Sigma Aldrich, and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from Rieke Metals.

Subsequently, the as-prepared precursor solution was kept at 60 \u00b0C overnight. After cooling down to room temperature, 0.1 mL hydrogen iodide (HI) with a concentration of 100 \u03bcL mL was added into the solution and stirred for 30 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films were obtained by spin-coating the mixed precursor solution onto clean TiO2 coated FTO (Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and subsequently annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 20 min in a glove box under argon atmosphere.\nThe microstructures of the as-prepared perovskite films were investigated by GIXRD performed at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using X-ray with a wavelength of 1.24 \u00c5 at a grazing incidence angle of 0.2\u00b0. The GIXRD patterns were collected by using a MarCCD 225 detector with a sample\u2013detector distance of 160 mm, which will be presented later in q coordinates using the equation q = 4\u03c0sin\u03b8/\u03bb, where \u03b8 is half of the diffraction angle and the \u03bb of 1.24 \u00c5 is the wavelength of X-rays with a photon energy of 10 keV. In the present GIXRD data, q has been calibrated by measuring the XRD of a lanthanum hexaboride reference sample. The SEM images of the films were taken by using a high resolution electron beam lithography system (CABL-9000C).\nFor photoemission experiments, the as-prepared perovskite films were transferred into an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system with a base pressure better than 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 mbar and kept in vacuum overnight for degassing at 100 \u00b0C. After being degassed, rubrene molecules (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) were deposited onto perovskite substrates using a standard Knudsen-cell. Photoemission measurements were performed in situ at room temperature after each deposition using a PHOIBOS 100 analyzer together with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al K\u03b1: 1486.61 eV) for XPS and a helium light lamp (He I: 21.2 eV) for UPS, respectively. Using a gold reference sample, the instrumental energy resolution for XPS and UPS was estimated to be 0.45 eV and 15 meV, respectively. The rubrene film thicknesses were calibrated by the attenuation of Pb 4f7/2 XPS intensities from the perovskite substrates after each deposition. To extract the WF from the SECO in the UPS spectra, a \u221210 V bias was applied to the samples. All photoemission spectra were collected at normal emission, and the binding energy was referred to the Fermi level of a sputter-cleaned gold foil electrically connected to the sample.

For the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles, HAuCl4\u00b73H2O was directly added to the mp-TiO2 solution and spin-coated on a FTO/Bl-TiO2 substrate. After drying at 125 \u00b0C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 \u00b0C, baked at this temperature for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. However, this method is not convenient for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles with mp-TiO2. Therefore, we have followed the method of synthesizing Au nanoparticles.\n\nInitially, Au NPs were synthesized by a chemical route. In typical experiments, a 1 mM aqueous solution of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4\u00b73H2O) was boiled for 30 min under reflux. About 2.5 mL of a 1% w/w aqueous solution of trisodium citrate dihydrate was added simultaneously under magnetic stirring over a period of 20 min. The obtained clear red solution was slowly cooled to room temperature. About 2.5 mL of a 5% solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in deionized water was added to the abovementioned red solution and further stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min and the synthesized Au NP dispersed in ethanol. The desired amount of this solution of Au NP was mixed with commercial mp-TiO2/ethanol paste and spin-coated onto a FTO/Bl-TiO2 substrate.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (PVP K90, MW = 130000), ethanol (Daejung), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4, Junsei) and acetic acid (Kanto Chemical) were used as initial precursors for the deposition of nanofibers. All these chemicals were used without further purification.\nPreparation of TiO2 feeding solution. In a typical experiment, 3 g PVP was dissolved in 27 g ethanol under vigorous stirring. Then, a 6 mL solution of Ti(OiPr)4 was dissolved in an equal volume of acetic acid and ethanol. These two solutions were kept separately for constant stirring for 24 h. The clear solution of Ti(OiPr)4 was mixed with the ethanolic solution of PVP drop by drop and finally stirred for a further 5 h to obtain a colloidal solution.\nPreparation of TiO2 and Au@TiO2 nanofibers. The abovementioned prepared electrospinning solution was carefully sucked into a 5 mL glass syringe and fixed horizontally arranged electrospinning equipment (SGE Analytical Science). The positive electrode was connected to the needle of the syringe containing the precursor solution. The drum rotating speed (400 rpm) and the distance between the anode and cathode (15 cm) were kept constant. The spinning rate was kept at 1.0 mL h\u22121 by a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific). For the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles, HAuCl4\u00b73H2O was added to the electrospinning solutions and the solutions were then instantly loaded into a syringe. Au-embedded TiO2 nanofibers of different compositions were synthesized by the addition of various amounts of HAuCl4\u00b73H2O to the TiO2-PVP precursor solution at loading ratios of 0.1 wt% to 0.6 wt%. In this investigation, we added different quantities of a solution of HAuCl4\u00b73H2O (0.0042, 0.0084, 0.0126, 0.0168, 0.0210, and 0.0252 g) to 3 mL TiO2-PVP precursor solution to deposit TiO2 nanofibers. These nanofibers were further used for perovskite solar cells and new results for Au nanoparticles versus TiO2 nanofibers have been added in a revised manuscript. At this point, an electric field potential of 9 kV was applied between the needle tip and a grounded substrate at a distance of 15 cm. Finally, after heat treatment at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h in air, reflective white and bluish Au-embedded TiO2 nanofibers (Au@TiO2 nanofibers) were obtained (ESI Fig. S12\u2020). The temperature of thermal annealing was optimized by TGA analysis (ESI Fig. S13\u2020). The crystallinity and composition of the nanofibers were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS mapping analysis (ESI Fig. S14, Fig. S15, and Fig. S16\u2020). A paste of synthesized bare and Au@TiO2 nanofibers was prepared using terpineol and ethyl cellulose in an ethanol solvent and used for spin-coating.\nPreparation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by the dropwise addition of hydriodic acid (aqueous, 57 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) to a solution of methylamine (aqueous, 40 wt%, TCI Chemicals) in an ice bath. The ice-cold solution was stirred for 2 h and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (95 mbar vacuum, 400 rpm rotation). The white product was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized using diethyl ether. Fresh white crystals were washed three times using diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum for 24 h. The resulting white solid product was further used for the synthesis of MAPbI3.\nThe MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of MAI and lead iodide (PbI2) (Aldrich, 99.999%) in anhydrous \u03b3-butyrolactone (40% by weight, Sigma-Aldrich) at 70 \u00b0C and stirred for 12 h. The prepared yellow solution was further filtered twice using a syringe filter (Whatman GD/X PVDF, pore size 0.45 \u03bcm). The clear yellow solution was dripped on top of a mp-TiO2 film and the film was soaked for 1 min and then spun at 2000 rpm for 45 s and 3000 rpm for 45 s at one ramp rate. The film was placed on a hotplate at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min to form dark brown crystalline MAPbI3. We investigated and optimized the best performance based on measurements from thermogravimetric analysis (ESI Fig. S17\u2020).\nThe hole-transport material (HTM) was prepared by a standard procedure reported elsewhere with a few modifications. A total of 180 mg 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Merck) was dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich) with the addition of 37.5 \u03bcL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg mL\u22121) in acetonitrile and 17.5 \u03bcL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich). (Please note that HTM is not stable for a long time; therefore, we prepared a fresh solution of HTM before each experiment.) The MAPbI3 + TiO2 composite films were coated with HTM solution using a spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30s. We took precautions for proper pore filling. Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar. For the counter electrode, an 80 nm thick layer of Au was deposited on the top of the HTM overlayer by thermal evaporation (growth rate \u223c0.5 \u00c5 s\u22121). For comparison, we also prepared and characterized devices based on commercial P25 paste and Au@TiO2 (ESI Fig. S18, Fig. S19 and Fig. S20\u2020).

ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 \u03a9 sq\u22121 were from Shenzhen Display (China).\n\nITO glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, and then sequentially cleaned with acetone, ultrapure water, and isopropyl in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. The ITO glass was dried with N2 and treated with O2 plasma for 10 min to improve the wettability. PEDOT:PSS was fabricated on the ITO substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 25 s, and then thermally treated at 140 \u00b0C for 10 min. The substrates were taken into a glovebox filled with nitrogen. PTAA with a concentration of 5 mg mL\u22121 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at different speeds (3k, 4k, 5k and 6k rpm) for 40 s and then annealed at 105 \u00b0C for 10 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) into anhydrous DMF and DMSO (9:1 by volume), with a concentration of 1.2 M. The perovskite precursor solutions were stirred at room temperature overnight to promote dissolution of solid materials. The additive (0\u201315 mol% FAAc) was added into the perovskite solution before spin-coating. A 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE filter was used to filter the perovskite precursor solution before spin-coating. Specifically, the perovskite solution was spin coated onto PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm for 40 s. During spin coating, the perovskite surface was disposed by toluene to get high quality surface coverage as Seok reported. The perovskite films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. A thin film of PCBM (circa 30 nm) was deposited onto the top of the perovskite layer with a concentration of 12 mg mL\u22121 at a speed of 1500 rpm for 20 s. At the end, the samples were taken into a thermal evaporation chamber, where 100 nm Al was deposited. At the same time, the device area was defined as 0.1 cm2 for each cell by a shadow mask.\n\nThe thicknesses of the perovskite films were estimated using a Veeco Dektak150 surface profiler. The surface morphology of the films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films were obtained with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Fluoromax 4 spectrometer (HORIBA JobinYvon) with photoexcitation at 507 nm. The absorption spectra of the perovskite films on ITO glass were observed using a spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/vis) in the range from 500 to 850 nm.

A phosphorus (POCl3) diffused n++ (130.0 ohm sq\u22121) high-low junction was formed on the rear side. A boron (BBr3) diffused p++ emitter (125.1 ohm sq\u22121 to 15.1 ohm sq\u22121) was formed on the front and was well defined to define the active area. The metal contact on the rear consists of Ti/Pd/Ag. The rest of the non-contacted rear was passivated by thermally grown and annealed SiO2. These polished silicon solar cells with an un-passivated p++ front were then directly used as a substrate for the fabrication of the top perovskite cell. To complete full tandem fabrication, the polished silicon solar cells were treated with a UVO cleaner for 6 min before SnO2 deposition. The SnO2 colloidal precursor (Alfa Aesar, tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was diluted with H2O to 3.75%. Then, the diluted SnO2 colloidal precursor was directly spin coated on the front of the silicon solar cells at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by baking on a hotplate at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min in air to form a compact SnO2 ETL. After cooling down, the SnO2 coated silicon substrates were directly transferred to a N2 filled glovebox for the fabrication of the MAPbI3 absorber using a two-step method. Different concentrations of PbI2 precursor were prepared by dissolving PbI2 powder (Alfa Aesar) of different weight (461 mg, 553 mg and 737 mg) in 1 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) with excess dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, 71 \u03bcL, 82 \u03bcL and 114 \u03bcL) which was then spin coated on the SnO2 coated silicon cell at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The MAI precursor (Greatcell Soalr) (dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich) at 40 mg mL\u22121; 50 mg mL\u22121; or 68 mg mL\u22121) was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were dried at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min producing dark brown dense MAPbI3 films with different thicknesses depending on the concentrations of precursors used.\nFor the deposition of the hole transport material (HTM), the 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, Lumtec) precursor was firstly prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 \u03bcL 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 17.5 \u03bcL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg mL\u22121 in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich)) and 8 \u03bcL FK209-cobalt(III)-TFSI (Lumtec) solution (300 mg FK209-cobalt(III)-TFSI in 1 ml of acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich). The spiro-OMeTAD precursor was then deposited onto MAPbI3 by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s.\nFor the front transparent electrode, 18 nm MoO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was deposited on the spiro-OMeTAD by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.7 \u00c5 s\u22121 under vacuum at 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 mTorr to protect the spiro-OMeTAD layer from sputtering damage during the deposition of indium tin oxide (ITO). The transparent contact was then fabricated by sputtering 100 nm ITO on the MoOx layer with 30 W RF power with Ar at 1.5 mTorr for 150 min using an AJA International sputtering system. A metal frame of silver was deposited by thermal evaporation to a thickness of 200 nm defining the active area of the cell. Finally, the front of the cell is covered by a textured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foil for light trapping and antireflection (AR), see Fig. S8 (ESI\u2020).\n\nThe depth dependent doping profiles of the p++ emitter of half silicon cells were measured using an electrochemical capacitance\u2013voltage (ECV, CVP21, WEP) analyzer, calibrated using \u03c1sh to account for the surface roughness.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Scientific, UK.\nThe current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) measurements of tandem devices were performed using a solar cell J\u2013V testing system from Abet Technologies, Inc. (using a class AAA solar simulator) under an illumination power of 100 mW cm\u22122 with a metal aperture (4 cm2 and 16 cm2) and a scan rate of 30 mV s\u22121 in the direction from the open-circuit voltage (VOC) to the short-circuit current density (JSC) (1.8 V to \u22120.1 V). The J\u2013V curves of the best tandem devices were also measured with a forward scan at a scan rate of 30 mV s\u22121 in the JSC to VOC direction (\u22120.1 V to 1.8 V). The light was calibrated using a certified reference cell. The bias voltage for the steady-state measurements was chosen as the average of the maximum power point (MPP) voltage of the J\u2013V measurement.\nThe external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out using the PV Measurement QXE7 Spectral Response system with monochromatic light from a xenon arc lamp. The EQE response was calibrated using two certified reference cells for the 300\u20131000 nm and 1000\u20131400 nm wavelength regions, respectively. A blue LED light (450 nm) and a near-infrared lamp were used to saturate the top and the bottom cell for the EQE measurement of the bottom silicon cell and the top perovskite cell, respectively.\nThe steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were made with an Andor iVac CCD detector (the detector temperature is \u221260 \u00b0C). The excitation wavelength of the CW laser was 409 nm and the signal was collected using a 0.2 second exposure time.\nTop view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field emission SEM (NanoSEM 230). The optical reflection and transmission spectra were measured using a Perkin Elmer Lambda1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer. All measurements were undertaken at room temperature in ambient conditions.\n\nThe optical simulations of the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell were performed using SunSolve\u2122 ray tracing from PVLighthouse. Optically, silicon was treated to be bulk and non-coherent in the simulation. The simulation package does not allow for carrier recombination input. Therefore 100% internal quantum efficiency is assumed for both the top and bottom cells. The optical values (n, k) of SnO2, the perovskite, spiro-MeOTAD, MoO3 and ITO were all extracted from spectral ellipsometry measurements (JA Woollam Inc.) and fitted by WVASE\u00ae software. Other optical values (n, k) of PDMS, Ag and NiOx are obtained from PVLighthouse.\n\nA commercial software package, Sentaurus technology computer-aided design (TCAD), was used to investigate the carrier transport mechanism between SnO2 and Si. The simulator solves Poisson, drift-diffusion and carrier conservation equations numerically until self-consistency is reached. The heterojunction was modelled with a similar approach to . For Si, state-of-the-art models highlighted by Altermatt and the latest Auger model were applied in the simulation to accurately predict silicon characteristics. For SnO2, the key material parameters are determined from various papers as listed in Table 1. Several essential models are employed to compute carrier transport including Fermi statistics, and Shockley\u2013Reed\u2013Hall models. Due to the bandgap discontinuity at the hetero-interface, the thermionic emission model is applied to compute the current density and energy flux density across the interface.

After this, a layer of hole transport material (72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 \u03bcL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 28.8 \u03bcL of tBP were dissolved in 1 mL of CB) was spin-coated on the perovskite active layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s to form the hole transport layer. Finally, a metallic silver electrode was deposited by the magnetron sputtering technique.\n\nThe morphology of the perovskite film was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS EV0MA15). The crystal structure of the perovskite film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX-2700, Dandong) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.15406 nm) at the scanning rate of 5\u00b0 min\u22121. The absorption spectrum of the perovskite film was obtained using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer (UV-2600, SHIMADZU). The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy were performed at 475 nm upon excitation at 450 nm at the pulse frequency of 1 MHz (FLS980, Edinburgh). The photocurrent\u2013voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells were determined using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua) under AM 1.5 simulated illumination (CEL-S500, Beijing, China). The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using an IPCE system (PVE 300, Bentham, Inc.) in the wavelength range of 300\u2013800 nm.

All chemicals were used as received.\n\nK chunks and rubrene powder were stored and handled in an argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm), then transferred to a Pyrex ampoule at a molar ratio of 2:1. After being sealed under vacuum (<10\u22124 mbar), reactions were performed at 210 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 1\u00b0C min\u22121 and a dwelling time of 3 days. The products were then reground and re-pelletized for another 3 day reaction at the same temperatures to yield the final product K2Rubrene.\nThe PSCs were prepared on FTO substrates which were cleaned in detergent and then successively sonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol solution, and then dried in an oven at 80 \u00b0C. Prior to the deposition of electron transport layers (ETLs), FTO substrates were exposed to UV\u2013ozone for 20 min. A SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) film was prepared according to the report of Fang et al. Perovskite photoactive layers were deposited on the ETLs by an anti-solvent method, as described in the literature. The (CsI)0.04(FAI)0.82(PbI2)0.86(MAPbBr3)0.14 and MAPbI3 precursor solutions were prepared in a glove box from 1.35 M Pb2+ in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 v/v). The dissolved solution was then spin-coated on the FTO/SnO2 QD ETLs substrate at 4500 rpm for 30 s in a glove box; note that 150 \u03bcL K2Rubrene and rubrene chlorobenzene solution of 1 mM concentrations were pipetted onto the spinning film 15 s before the end of this program. Thereafter, the as-cast perovskite films were annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.

Finally, gold was deposited by thermal evaporation on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer to complete the device, using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes. The active area of the cells was 0.09 cm2, which was defined by the area of the Au electrode.\n\nThe J\u2013V characteristics of the devices were measured using a B1500 A semiconductor parameter analyzer under an AAA class ORIEL Sol3A solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 filter, the light intensity was set at 100 mW cm\u22122 using a calibrated standard monocrystalline Si reference cell from Newport traceable to NREL. The hole-only devices with the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/K2Rubrene (or rubrene)/Au structure were measured under dark ambient conditions. Scanning was carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 V s\u22121.

The corresponding incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured in air by a QE-R 3011 system from Enli Technology Co. Ltd. (Enli).\nUV-visible spectroscopy was performed using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-2550 Shimadzu) in the 200\u2013800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a reflectance (ATR) instrument (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100, USA) from 4000 to 800 cm\u22121 with a resolution of 2 cm\u22121. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The morphologies of PSCs were investigated by a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM7100F). Based on the tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker NanoScope MultiMode 8) system, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) simultaneously measures contact potential difference (CPD) between the probe (Nanosensor PPP-EFM) and the surface of a perovskite sample by constantly probing. For our EFM measurements, a two-pass technique with phase mode was employed. The first pass was used to acquire the topographic height, and then the conductive probe was lifted with respect to the specimen surface with a constant separation, approximately 10 nm here, and scanned to acquire the potential offset between the tip and the sample. The first resonant oscillation of the cantilever (52.590 kHz) was used for the non-contact AFM topographic imaging. The second resonant frequency (60 kHz) was used for the potential imaging. We chose a scan rate of 0.977 Hz and a DC bias of 1 V applied to the conductive probe. The sample was fixed in a custom-made vertical sample holder with electrical connections to both electrodes. For photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements, the perovskite film was deposited on quartz substrate and then immersed into FC-72. A monochromatic light beam was modulated at 13 Hz by a mechanical chopper and was shone onto the sample. A laser was at the perpendicular side so that it was deflected periodically. A position detector, connected with a lock-in amplifier, was placed on the other side so that the deflection signal was measured. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) signals of perovskite film were recorded using the Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrophotometer equipped with a 485 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser as the excitation source.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: SnO2-QDs,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: Cs0.04FA0.82MA0.14PbBr0.42I2.58,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: CsFAMAPbBrI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 150,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.09,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were used as received.\nPreparation of the La\u2013BaSnO3 nanoparticles and paste.

UV-vis absorption spectra and transmittance spectrum were obtained using the UV-vis spectrophotometer (SOLID3700, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Japan). The carrier mobilities of the mp-LBSO and mp-TiO2 films were measured by the steady-state DC current\u2013voltage analysis using a computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzer land).

PH1000 (Clevios) with 5 wt% DMSO was spin coated on the PET/Ag-grid at 600 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min. The remaining operations in the preparation of the flexible pero-SCs are the same as that of the pero-SCs on the ITO substrate.\n\nThe time-dependent absorption spectra of pero-TFs during rtMSVA treatment were measured on a Cary 5000 (Agilent) instrument. In order to make a parallel comparison and avoid the influence of ITO, the pero-TFs were deposited on glass/PEDOT:PSS substrates. XRD patterns were collected using an X'Pert-Pro MRD diffractometer (Panalytical). A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4700, Hitachi, Japan) was used for morphology observations. The J\u2013V curves of the pero-SCs were measured in a glovebox on a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm\u22122) illumination calibrated by a standard Si-SC.

The patterned FTO substrates were subsequently cleaned in ultrasonic baths (Branson 1500) containing mucasol (Sigma-Aldrich), de-ionized water, methanol (Alfa-Aesar), acetone (Alfa-Aesar) and 2-propanol (J.T.Baker), respectively (each for 10 minutes). Afterwards, the substrates were dried with nitrogen, followed by heat treatment at 120 \u00b0C for 20 mins to remove the last traces of any solvent. A hole transporting layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 1 min using a PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, HERAEUS) solution in 2-propanol (J.T.Baker) (1:3 ratio), which was annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 20 min. To form the active layer of perovskite, a precursor solution of MAPbI3\u2212xClx was prepared by dissolving equimolar ratios of lead iodide (PbI2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, Sigma-Aldrich) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) in a concentration of 11 wt%.

The solution was then immediately spin-coated on top of the hot PEDOT:PSS layer so that the substrate temperature was retained. Then, the devices were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. PCBM, used as an ETL, was spun on top of the perovskite layer at 1250 rpm for 60 s using a solution of 2 wt% PCBM (Nano-C, 99.5%) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Alfa-Aesar, 99%).

For the PL measurement, an excitation wavelength of 450 nm was used and the emission spectra were measured from 600 nm to 850 nm. For the time-resolved PL (TRPL), a high-speed photomultiplier tube detector (FL-1073, Horriba scientific Inc.) was employed for photon counting with a repetition rate of 4 MHz and 450 nm excitation.\n\nSurface and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the perovskite film were collected by a Hitachi S-4700 field emission SEM (FESEM). Images were taken at different magnifications and accelerating voltages. A thin conductive layer of gold (Au) was coated on the film using a Hummer V Sputter Coater before scanning the surface and cross-section of the film. The sheet resistance of the perovskite film was measured using a Jandel RM3 four-point probe.

Then, they were further cleaned with ultraviolet ozone treatment (UV-O3) for 15 min before device fabrication.\nFor PSCs with the n\u2013i\u2013p configuration: the compact TiOx and FeOx electron extraction layer (EEL) was fabricated by spin-coating an acidic ethanol solution (0.12 M) of titanium isopropoxide and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O), respectively, at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. The substrates were subsequently heated at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min and further annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 1 hour. We then spin-coated an 8 mg mL\u22121 solution of PCBM in chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm for 30 s for passivating the TiOx surface. This modified TiO2 is denoted as TiOx(m). A perovskite layer with a composition of CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited by spin-coating the precursor solution composed of CH3NH3I and lead iodide (PbI2) (molar ratio of 1:1; 1.35 M) in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (with a volume ratio of 7:3) onto the EEL at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Meanwhile, chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate for 10 s after the spin-coating commences. The as-deposited film was then heated at 100 \u00b0C for crystallization for 15 min. Spiro-OMeTAD solution, consisting of 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 \u03bcL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile (520 mg mL\u22121), and 28.8 \u03bcL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 1 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene, was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s to form the HEL. Finally, a Au electrode with a thickness of around 90 nm was deposited on top of the HEL by thermal evaporation for the n\u2013i\u2013p structured PSCs.\nFor PSCs with the p\u2013i\u2013n configuration: A NiOx compact hole extraction layer (HEL) was fabricated by spin-coating a solution of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O) in anhydrous ethanol (0.1 M) at 4000 rpm for 30 s twice. Before the second spin-coating, the film was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 15 min. Afterwards, the film was sintered at 350 \u00b0C for 30 min. The preparation method of the perovskite layer is the same as that mentioned for the n\u2013i\u2013p structured PSC fabrication. Then, PCBM in anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mg mL\u22121) was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s to prepare the EEL for the p\u2013i\u2013n structured PSCs. As the final step, silver with a thickness of about 120 nm was thermally evaporated onto the EELs to fabricate a top electrode for the p\u2013i\u2013n PSCs.\n\nThe film morphology and thickness information were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, EHT = 5.0 kV, WD = 6.5 mm, Zeiss LEO1530, Germany). Ultraviolet-visible absorption and transmission spectra were recorded using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer at room temperature with an integrating sphere detector (250\u2013800 nm, PerkinElmer, USA). Steady-state and transient PL decay spectra were obtained using an FLS920 transient optical spectrometer. Steady-state PL measurements were measured by exciting the sample using a monochromatic xenon lamp source with a central wavelength of 460 nm. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system. Samples were photoexcited using a 405 nm laser beam (EPL405), pulsed at frequencies between 10 and 20 MHz, with a pulse duration of <100 ps and the maximum fluorescence intensity. The J\u2013V characteristics of the linear voltage scan and stepwise voltage scan were measured using a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) under AM 1.5G illumination, with the device illuminated by a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (PT-SI-RSC, Pharos Technology). The active area (0.06 cm2) of the devices for photovoltaic J\u2013V measurement was determined by a metal aperture.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | PCBM-60,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 15,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.06,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "The material CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized based on the literature. In short, to prepare MAI, hydroiodic acid (10 mL, 57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and methylamine (10 mL, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich) were reacted in a round bottomed flask in ice-cold water with stirring for 60 min. Raw CH3NH3I was obtained by removing the solvent at 50 \u00b0C on a rotary evaporator. The material was then washed in diethyl ether and filtered several times. The precipitate was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 50 \u00b0C and then stored in nitrogen-filled glovebox.\n\nThe evaporation was carried out in Angstrom Engineering EvoVac deposition system with integrated Innovative Technology glovebox. The PbCl2 and MAI materials were both evaporated from ceramic crucibles. The evaporation rate was monitored by the quartz crystals. The quartz crystals could be reused after dipping in DMF solution and then washing in ethanol. New quartz crystal was used for each evaporation. The undulating evaporated CH3NH3I film makes it difficult to measure the accurate thickness. To avoid the tedious calibration process for the evaporation (or deposition) rate of each material, we set the tooling factor (which is a ratio of the film deposition rate monitored by sensor to that on the substrate) to be 100% during all the co-evaporation process. Initially, the evaporator sources were heated slowly to an level that the evaporation rate was just around the desired range, the process were then carried out in auto mode. A desired evaporation rate can be obtained via heating control system from the feedback of their sensors. After the evaporation rate were stabilized for a prolonged time, the PbCl2 film and MAI film were then co-evaporated onto the substrates with substrate baffle open. Various MAI evaporation rate (0\u20138 \u00c5 s\u22121) were employed. The evaporation rate of PbCl2 material was maintained at constant monitored rate of 2 \u00c5 s\u22121.\n\nSolar cells with FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/Ag planar device structure were prepared. Before deposition of other films, the FTO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol sequentially, and were then blow-dried in nitrogen. After that, PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevious Al 4083) was spin-coated on FTO-coated substrates at 2000 rpm for 45 s, and subsequently the PEDOT:PSS films were annealed at 150 \u00b0C for 20 min. After cooling down, perovskite absorbers were evaporated on PEDOT:PSS films. The evaporated perovskite films were then annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 45 min on a hot plate. 30 mg ml\u22121 PCBM (FEM. Inc.) solution in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) was then spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 45 s.

Powder diffraction was performed on a Bruker Discover D8 with CuKa1/2 source and a scintillation detectior 4860.\nSingle yellow block-shaped crystals of EtO-DATPA were recrystallised from benzene by slow evaporation. Single orange block-shaped crystals of iPrO-DATPA were recrystallised from benzene by slow evaporation. Single yellow plate-shaped crystals of nPrO-DATPA were recrystallised from a mixture of DCM and hexane by slow evaporation. Single orange block-shaped crystals of BuO-DATPA were recrystallized from benzene by slow evaporation. A suitable crystal of EtO-DATPA (0.24 \u00d7 0.16 \u00d7 0.14), iPrO-DATPA (0.51 \u00d7 0.23 \u00d7 0.10), nPrO-DATPA (0.55 \u00d7 0.29 \u00d7 0.09) and BuO-DATPA (0.25 \u00d7 0.24 \u00d7 0.14) were selected and mounted on a MITIGEN holder in Paratone oil on a Rigaku Oxford Diffraction SuperNova diffractometer. The crystal was kept at T = 120.0 K during data collection. Using Olex2 (Dolomanov et al., 2009), the structure was solved with the ShelXS (Sheldrick, 2008) structure solution program, using the Direct Methods solution method. The model was refined with version of ShelXL (Sheldrick, 2008) using Least Squares minimisation. A summary of the data collection and structure refinement is reported in Table S4 (ESI\u2020).\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on NETZSCH STA 449F1 at a scan rate of 5 K min\u22121 under a nitrogen atmosphere in DSC/TG aluminium pan. The measurement range was 25 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C.\n\nAll cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in freshly distilled CH2Cl2 using 0.3 M [TBA][BF4] electrolyte in a three-electrode system with each solution being purged with N2 prior to measurement. The working electrode was a Pt disk, the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl, and the counter electrode was a Pt rod. All measurements were made at room temperature using a \u03bcUTOLAB Type III potentiostat, driven by the electrochemical software GPES. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements used scan rates of 100 mV s\u22121: square wave voltammetry (SWV) was carried out at a step potential of 4 mV, square wave amplitude of 25 mV, and a square wave frequency of 10 Hz, giving a scan rate of 40 mV s\u22121. Ferrocene was used as the internal standard in each measurement.\n\nAll calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program with Lee\u2013Yang\u2013Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) level of theory. All atoms were described by the 6-31G(d) basis set. All structures were input and processed through the Avogadro software package.\n\nThe Ossila low-density pre-fabricated substrates (channel length 0.1 mm width 0.03 mm) with a bottom gate/bottom contact were used to fabricate OFET devices. The substrates were treated with HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane) to optimise the silicon surface property. A solution of the HTM (5 mg ml\u22121) in dichlorobenzene was stirred at room temperature. The Ossila substrate was covered with the solution by drop-casting. The electric characteristics of the fabricated OFETs were measured using a Keithley 2612A System SourceMeter. Mobilities were calculated using the following equation\nwhere Z is the channel width, L the channel length, Ci the capacitance, VG the gate voltage and IDS is the drain current and , the slope of the transfer characteristic curves in the saturation regime.\n\nSample preparation. A solution of mesoporous TiO2 in terpineol (Dyesol 30 nm TiO2, weight ratio 1:2) was spin coated on a 10 mm by 10 mm glass square, with an acceleration of 12000 rpm for 30 s. The pieces of glass were cleaned with isopropanol (IPA) in a sonicator for 5 minutes before spin coating. After spin coating, the substrates were placed into a 450 \u00b0C oven for 1 hour and cooled down to room temperature before deposition of the perovskite layer. For the deposition of the perovskite layer 1 M solution of PbI2 and MeNH3I in DMSO was prepared. This solution was spin-coated onto the glass slides covered with the mesoporous oxide via a 3-step spin coating process: (i) 1000 rpm, 10 s, 2000 acc; (ii) 5000 rpm, 20 s, 2000 acc; (iii) 6000 rpm, 20 s, 2000 acc. Toluene (300 \u03bcL) was dropped on the substrates by the end of the second step. The films were then annealed at 50 \u00b0C for 20 min and at 100 \u00b0C for 25\u201330 min and cooled down to room temperature. A 20 mg ml\u22121 solution in chlorobenzene of the corresponding HTM was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 200 rpm for 30 s, with an acceleration of 2000.\nMeasurements. UV-Vis was performed on a PerkinElmer UV/VIS Spectrometer Lambda 25. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Yobin-Ybon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer, using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and slit widths of 10 nm. For pump\u2013probe micro to millisecond transient absorption spectroscopy, films were excited by a dye laser (Photon Technology International GL-301, sub-nanosecond pulse width) pumped by a pulsed nitrogen laser (Photon Technology International GL-3300). A quartz halogen lamp (Bentham IL1) was passed through a monochromator and used to probe changes in the absorption characteristics of the film as a function of time after the laser excitation. The probe light was detected using home-built silicon (\u22641000 nm) or InxGa1\u2212xAs (>1000 nm) photodiodes and an oscilloscope. Unless otherwise stated, films were kept under flowing N2 during the measurements. All micro to millisecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted employing 450 nm laser pulses (25 \u03bcJ cm\u22122).\n\nEtched FTO glass substrates (NSG Pilkington, TEC7) were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionised water, acetone and ethanol before undergoing 10 minutes of O2 plasma treatment. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the glass substrates through spray pyrolysis of a 0.2 M solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in isopropanol at 450 \u00b0C. Upon cooling, a mesoporous layer of TiO2 nanoparticles was spin-coated from a 2:7 wt suspension of Dyesol 30NR-D paste in ethanol (4500 rpm for 30 seconds), followed by sintering at 550 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. A CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 576 mg PbI2, and 199 mg CH3NH3I in a 4:1 vol solution of DMF:DMSO. 100 \u03bcl of the perovskite precursor solution was deposited onto the TiO2 films and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds, with 200 \u03bcl of ethyl acetate dripped onto the spinning substrate 10 seconds prior to the end of the spin-coating process. Perovskite films were annealed at 100 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. In the case of the spiro-OMeTAD HTM, a 85 mg ml\u22121 solution of spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene was prepared with dopants including bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) (20 \u03bcl ml\u22121 of a 520 mg ml\u22121 solution in acetonitrile), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 30 \u03bcl ml\u22121) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluorome-thylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, 10 \u03bcl ml\u22121 of a 300 mg ml\u22121 solution in acetonitrile). For other HTMs, the same weight of material was dissolved in chlorobenzene with 2 times the volume of additives included. The higher dopant concentration used for the DATPA HTMs was found to be beneficial due to the deeper HOMO level of these compared with spiro-OMeTAD. The HTM solution was spin-coated onto perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds before 80 nm thick Au contacts were thermally evaporated onto devices.\nCurrent\u2013voltage measurements were performed using a AAA-rated solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A) calibrated against a KG5-filtered reference diode (Oriel 91150-KG5). Solar cells were masked to 0.1 cm2 and scanned both from forward to reverse bias and vice versa at 100 mV s\u22121.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-c | TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spray-pyrolys | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: EtO-DATPA,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "CH3NH3I, PbI2 and PbCl2 were purchased from the Materials Co. in Canada and Alfa Aesar Co. in China. PbI2, PbCl2 and CH3NH3I3 (2 M:1 M:1 M) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; Aldrich Co.) as the precursor solutions. All of the precursor solutions were stirred at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h, which when the mass concentration was 30 wt% gave polymeric precursor solution. The hole transport layer used PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Sigma-Aldrich), purchased from Bayer Co., Germany. The electron transport layer used phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) material, purchased from Banhe Technology Co. The PC60BM concentration was 20 mg mL\u22121, dissolved in chlorobenzene (Aldrich Co.), and stirred at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h. Electrodes for anode and cathode were ITO and aluminum (Al) electrodes, respectively. The whole device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al.\n\nFirstly, laser-patterned, ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic oscillation in an alkaline, aqueous washing solution for 15 min. Afterwards, they were rinsed successively with deionized water, ethanol and acetone, then placed into an O3 condition using ultraviolet treatment for 30 min. PEDOT:PSS was deposited by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s to give a thickness of 40 nm. All thickness measurements of thin films used surface step profilers (Brooker Co., Germany). Afterwards, the prepared perovskite (MAPbI3\u2212xClx) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS thin film at 1000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 4000 rpm for 35 s. The thin film was immediately annealed at 70 \u00b0C for 80 min. After cooling down, PC60BM (20 mg mL\u22121 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 45 s, followed by spin-coating an interface-modifying layer of PEIE (0.1 wt%, in anhydrous 2-propanol) at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, 80 nm thick Al layers were thermally deposited as the top electrodes under a vacuum of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa to fabricate perovskite solar cells with an area of 9 mm2. All devices were encapsulated by epoxy resin in a glove box for experimental measurements. The device structure is shown in Fig. 1. The DIO (Aldrich) concentrations were 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.5 wt%, added into the perovskite polymeric material as the precursor solution, and heated with stirring for 12 h at 80 \u00b0C.\n\nPhotovoltaic measurements were conducted using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport). The power output was adjusted to match AM 1.5 global sunlight (100 mW cm\u22122 by using a reference Si solar cell). Current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 100 ms, respectively. A similar data acquisition system was used to determine the monochromatic incident photon to electric current conversion efficiency. Under full computer control, light from a 300 W xenon lamp was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator onto the photovoltaic cell to be tested. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate IPCE(\u03bb), defined by IPCE(\u03bb) = 12400 (Jsc/\u03bb\u03c6), where \u03bb is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm\u22122), and \u03c6 is the incident radiative flux (mW cm\u22122). Photovoltaic performance was measured by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 10 mm2. The measurements were performed under bias light. The cross section of the device was measured by using a Zeiss Jemini FEG-SEM instrument at 5 kV with magnification of 250k.\nFig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for the different DIO doping concentrations of 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.5 wt%. From the XRD results, we found that the pure perovskite shows several main peaks, the corresponding diffraction angles being 14.1\u00b0, 28.4\u00b0, 31.9\u00b0, respectively. It is evident that the materials fabricated from perovskite solutions crystallize in a tetragonal crystal structure. XRD reflections confirm the MAPbI3\u2212xClx perovskite structure with lattice parameters a = b = 8.8724 \u00c5 and c = 12.5475 \u00c5 for the control sample and a = b = 8.8650 \u00c5 and c = 12.5370 \u00c5 for the sample with 1% DIO additive. In addition, in the XRD pattern there also appears a small peak at 12.6\u00b0, attributed to PbI2. When we added the DIO to the perovskite, the DIO additive has no effect on the perovskite phase structure, and no new peak appears. The DIO addition, on the one hand, makes the grain size of perovskite become larger; on the other hand, it increases the PbI2 grain size, making its phase structure characteristic become more prominent.\nFig. 3 shows SEM images of the pure and 1% DIO-doped perovskite thin films. We observed that both samples show full coverage on the substrate with the absence of pinholes. The perovskite grain size appears to be significantly enlarged by the addition of DIO, increasing from an average value of 25.6 to 50.5 nm for control and DIO-modified samples, respectively, and there is an increase the crystallinity of the perovskite thin film. We note that the SEM imaging is only sensitive to the surface of the film.

Molybdenum powder was purchased from Aladdin. First, 0.2 g of metal powder was dispersed in 20 ml ethanol with an ultra-sound bath. Then the solution was mixed with 0.7 ml hydrogen peroxide (30%). Ethanol was used to control the reaction rate between metal powders and hydrogen peroxide. During the reaction, ethanol will provide e\u2212 and H+ for the reduction of the metal peroxide; meanwhile H+ can be inserted into the metal oxide lattice to form metal oxide bronzes. After 20 hours of reaction, molybdenum oxide solution turned from gray to blue, which is attributed to the H+ insertion into the metal oxide lattice and then the reduction of a metal element (Mo6+) to the sub-state (Mo5+), forming hydrogen molybdenum bronzes (HxMoO3).

For the antisolvent with preheating, the perovskite precursor solution was diluted to 1.1 M, and both the chuck of the spin-coater and the SnO2 substrate were heated so that the substrate was spin-coated at the desired temperature. The chuck was made of aluminum and was directly heated by a hotplate without removing it from the spin-coater. After removing the hotplate, the temperature of the chuck was kept constant (within 5 \u00b0C) over 60 s after a slight temperature decrease in the first 20 s, which was adequate to finish the deposition of the perovskite films at the designed preheating temperature (40 \u00b0C or 70 \u00b0C).

Fabrication of the PSCs was conducted in ambient air except for the deposition of the HTM layers, which were spin-coated in the glovebox. It should be noted that the humidity level of the spin-coating chamber was controlled by introducing humid air. The humid air was obtained by flowing air through a flask filled with water. Control of the flow of humid air yielded different relative humidity levels. A temperature/humidity meter was used to monitor the relative humidity and temperature inside the spin-coating chamber.\n\nTop-view SEM images of the perovskite films were obtained using an FEI-Inspect F50, Holland.

Then it was stirred at room temperature for 15\u202fmin and transferred to a teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 170\u202f\u00b0C for 72\u202fh. The obtained precipitate was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol and soaked in 0.1\u202fM HCl solution for 24\u202fh. The final precipitate was repeatedly centrifuged and washed with distilled water to result in an aqueous solution with pH value of 7.0. Finally, the nanorods powder was annealed at 700\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh for better crystalline quality.\n\nThe white precipitate of TiO2NCs in water was sonicated with an ultrasonic horn (240\u00a0W, 120*0.5) in the first stage []. Then it was heated at 40\u202f\u00b0C and concentrated to form a 13\u202fwt% sol of TiO2NCs in water. The solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times to achieve a 40\u00a0wt% white precipitate of NCs in ethanol. The total precipitate (about 1.9\u00a0g) was quite dispersed in proper amount of ethanol in ultrasonic bath for 20\u00a0min. In parallel, two other solutions containing terpineol in ethanol and ethyl cellulose in ethanol (5\u201315\u00a0mPa; 56% and 15\u201330\u00a0mPa; 44%) were prepared and slowly added to the NCs solution. The final mixture was sonicated with an ultrasonic horn (240\u00a0W, 120*0.5\u00a0s) for three times for well-dispersion. Finally, the ethanol solvent was vacuum evaporated to form a TiO2paste composed of 20\u202fwt%, 71\u202fwt% and 9\u202fwt% of TiO2NCs, terpineol and ethyl cellulose respectively.\nFor preparation of TiO2NCs/NRs combinative paste, the as-prepared TiO2NRs powder was dispersed in ethanol solution with a weight ratio of 1:5.5. In parallel, the fabricated 20\u202fwt% TiO2NCs paste was diluted by ethanol with similar 1:5.5\u202fwt ratio. Then the specific amounts of diluted solutions (with calculated values of TiO2NCs and NRs) were mixed to form diluted combinative pastes with TiO2NRs/(TiO2NCs\u00a0+\u00a0TiO2NRs) weight ratios in the range of 0\u201320%. These solutions were finally heated at 40\u202f\u00b0C for preparation of 20\u202fwt% combinative TiO2NCs/NRs pastes.\n\nFluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were etched with Zinc powder and diluted HCl for electrical isolation of the photoanode and cathode electrodes.

Afterward, the substrates were heated at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin and subjected to a UV-Ozone treatment to remove the traces of organic residues. A compact TiO2layer was subsequently spin-coated at 2000\u202frpm, for 30\u202fs on the pre-treated substrates. A 0.15\u202fM solution of TTIP in anhydrous ethanol was normally applied in this deposition stage. Then a heating process was carried out at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh to prepare a severely attached TiO2compact layer on the TCO surfaces. The as-prepared combinative pastes of TiO2NPs and NRs were diluted in ethanol solutions (1:5.5\u202fwt ratio). Then they were deposited on FTO/compact TiO2layers by spin-coating method performed at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. These layers were finally annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin to remove the including terpineol and ethyl cellulose and form the appropriate anatase phase of the TiO2.\nFor the deposition of the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3perovskite layer a solution containing FAI (1\u202fM), CsI (0.05\u202fM), PbI2(1.1\u202fM), MABr (0.2\u202fM), and PbBr2(0.22\u202fM) in anhydrous DMF: DMSO solvent (4:1\u202fvol ratio) was prepared in the first stage.

The anti-solvent chlorobenzene solution was slowly poured at final 6\u202fs of the second step of spin coating process. The as-prepared multi-layers were subsequently heated at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh.\nThe Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer was over-deposited by another spin-coating process at 5000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher scientific, Al K\u03b1 radiation) analysis was employed to demonstrate the chemical bonding at the surface. The ultraviolet absorption spectra (UV\u2013vis) of the perovskite films were measure from the absorbance model (with integrating sphere) using a UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation) in the range of 300\u2013800\u00a0nm at a step bandwidth of 1\u00a0nm.

Finally, 80\u00a0nm gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.\nHole mobility of HTMs (HZ1, HZ2, and HZ3) were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/MoO3/HTMs/MoO3/Ag. For the hole-only devices, SCLC is described as J=98\u03b50\u03b5r\u03bcV2d3 where J is the current density, \u00b5 is the zero-field mobility, \u03b5 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, \u03b5 r is the relative permittivity of HTMs, d is the thickness of the HTMs (80\u00a0nm) and V is the applied effective voltage, respectively.\nThe crystalline morphology for perovskite films was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). A xenon light source solar simulator (450\u00a0W, Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5\u00a0G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122 at the surface of the solar cells. The photocurrent\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured by recording the current through Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The devices were tested using a metal mask with an area of 0.108\u00a0cm2. A similar data-acquisition system was used to control the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. A white-light bias was applied onto the sample during the IPCE measurements with the direct current (DC) model (130\u00a0Hz).\nTime-resolved luminescence decays were recorded with time-correlated single photo counting system (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant GmbH). The excitation light source was Ti: Sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent; 76\u00a0MHz, 130\u00a0fs). The photoluminescence (PL) was performed using the VERTEX 70 under the 532\u00a0nm laser at room temperature.\nThe contact angles were measured with an optical CA meter (OCA20, Dataphysics) at room temperature.\n1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400\u00a0MHz instrument with the solvent CDCl3. The melting point was measured on a SGW X-4B microscopic melting point apparatus. The absorption and emission spectra of the three compounds in CH2Cl2 solution were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu RF-5301\u00a0PC photoluminescence spectrometer, respectively.\nThe cyclic volammetry experiments were carried out on an electrochemistry workstation (e-corder (ED 401) poteneiostat) using hole-transporting material (HTM) dichloromethane solutions (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0M) containing TBAPF6 (0.1\u00a0M) as a supporting electrolyte at a 50\u00a0mV/s scan rate. A glass carbon electrode was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3\u00a0M in KCl) as the reference electrode. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was tested as the standard.\nFor the nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, about 50\u00a0\u00b5J of pulse energy as the fundamental output from a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond regenerative amplifier (800\u00a0nm, 35\u00a0fs FWHM, 1\u00a0kHz, Newport Spectra-Physics) was used to generate pump and probe beams. By introducing the fundamental beams into an optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion Ltd.), we could select a certain wavelength from the tunable output as the pump pulses, whereas light continuum probe pulses were obtained by focusing the fundamental beams onto a sapphire plate (contained in LP920, Edinburgh Instruments). The S-4 transmitted probe light from the samples were collected and focused on the broadband VIS-NIR detector for recording the time-resolved excitation induced difference spectrum (\u0394O.D.).\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: SnO2-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: ,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: Cl,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF >> IPA,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating >> Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 75 >> 135,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 30.0 >> 10.0,\n HTL_stack_sequence: H-Z1,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.108,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "PSCs were fabricated on F-doped SnO2 (NSG10) substrates previously cleaned by a sequential sonication treatment in a 2% Hellmanex solution, acetone, and isopropanol, followed by UV ozone treatment for 15\u00a0min. These substrates were directly used as described for the ETL-free PSCs. To prepare the other configurations investigated in this article, we deposited a compact blocking layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2, 30\u00a0nm in thickness) by spray pyrolysis using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol (22% v/v), followed by sintering at 450\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min (c-TiO2 electrode). SnO2 electrodes were prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution of SnCl4 (Acros) dissolved in water. For formation of a \u223c100-nm thick SnO2 layer, 0.5\u00a0M SnCl4 solution was spin-coated on the UV-ozone-treated FTO substrates at 5,000\u00a0rpm for\u00a010 s. The SnO2 film was then transferred onto a hotplate and dried at 100\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, post-annealed at 180\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr, and cooled down before deposition of perovskite. The planar configurations, including the ETL-free cells, were treated by UV ozone for 15\u00a0min before deposition of the perovskite layer. Finally, a 150-nm thick layer of mesoporous TiO2 (meso-TiO2, 30 NR-D titania paste from Dyesol) was prepared by spin-coating a diluted TiO2 dispersion in ethanol (150\u00a0mg\u00b7mL\u22121) at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0s followed by a sintering step at 450\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Afterward, the meso-TiO2 substrates were lithium-treated by spin-coating 40\u00a0\u03bcL of tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Li-TFSI, 10\u00a0mg/mL in acetonitrile) onto the mesoporous layer, followed by an additional sintering step at 450\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. After sintering, the c-TiO2/meso-TiO2 electrodes were ready to use and transferred to an N2 controlled atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I (MAI, Dyesol) and PbI2 (TCI) in N,N\u2032-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in a molarity of 1.20 for MAPbI3, while for the mixed cation/halide composition formamidinium iodide (FAI), MAI (from Dyesol), PbI2, and PbBr2 (TCI) were mixed in DMF/DMSO (4:1) solvent at 1.25\u00a0M to form (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, with 5% of PbI2 excess content. The perovskite layers were then fabricated by using a two-step spin-coating process reported by Seok et\u00a0al. (first step 1,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0s; second step 4,000\u00a0rpm for 30 s), and 10\u00a0s prior to the end of the program 100\u00a0\u03bcL of chlorobenzene was poured onto the films. The substrates were then annealed at 100\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min. Afterward, Spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4,000\u00a0rpm from a chlorobenzene solution (28.9\u00a0mg in 400\u00a0\u03bcL, 60\u00a0mmol) containing Li-TFSI (7.0\u00a0\u03bcL from a 520\u00a0mg/mL stock solution in acetonitrile), TBP (11.5\u00a0\u03bcL), and Co(II)TFSI (10\u00a0mol%, 8.8\u00a0\u03bcL from a 40\u00a0mg/mL stock solution) as dopants. Finally, a 70\u00a0nm gold electrode was evaporated.\n\nThe XRD patterns of the prepared films were measured using a D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg-Brentano geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu-K\u03b1, \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.5406\u00a0\u00c5). The absorption spectra were registered with a UV-Vis-IR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements were\u00a0performed in an ultra-high vacuum analysis chamber (base pressure of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0mbar) using an He-discharge UV source (Omicron) with an excitation energy of 21.2 eV for UPS. Before the analysis, the samples were treated by UV ozone for 15\u00a0min in the same conditions as for the device preparation. The photoelectron spectra were recorded using a Phoibos 100 (Specs) hemispherical energy analyzer at a pass energy of 5 eV for the valence band. For work function determination, the secondary electron cutoff (SECO) was recorded by applying a \u221210\u00a0V sample bias to clear the analyzer work function. The reported valence band spectra were background subtracted. The binding energies for all the photoemission spectra are referenced to the Fermi level. For the nanosecond-TAS/photoluminescence a nanosecond laser (5\u00a0ns pulse duration, 10\u00a0Hz, Ekspla NT342 model) with an integrated optical parametric oscillator system (from 355 to 2,500\u00a0nm tunability) was used as pump source. This was coupled with the LP980-KS Laser Flash Photolysis Spectrometer used for the measurement of laser-induced transient absorption and the photoluminescence kinetics and spectra. Wavelength-specific kinetic measurements were made using a photomultiplier and a digital storage oscilloscope. The\u00a0probe light was provided by a pulsed xenon arc lamp. The beams were focused onto the sample on a\u00a0minimum 5-mm2 diameter area, ensuring the spatial overlap. The transmitted probe was spectrally filtered by a monochromator and detected. From the transmission change following photoexcitation, the variation in the absorption was thus derived as \u0394O(\u03c4,\u03bb)\u00a0= log(I probe)/(I t(\u03c4,\u03bb)), where I probe is the transmitted probe with excitation off and I t is the transmitted probe after laser excitation. The minimum\u00a0detectable optical density of the LP980-KS using the photomultiplier is \u0394OD\u00a0= 0.002 (single-shot, fast-detector option) with a system overall response function of: <7\u00a0ns (laser limited).\n\nThe photovoltaic device performance was analyzed using a VeraSol LED solar simulator (Newport) producing 1 sun AM 1.5 (1,000 W/m2) sunlight. Current-voltage curves were measured in air with a potentiostat (Keithley 2604). The light intensity was calibrated with an NREL-certified KG5 filtered Si reference diode. The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture of 0.16\u00a0cm2 to define the active area. Current-voltage curves at different scan rates were collected from slowest to fastest scan rate by scanning in the FR direction followed by the RF direction for a given scan rate, with a time interval of 10\u00a0s (under illumination) before the next measurement.

Methylammonium bromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) salts were obtained from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp, China. Spiro-OMeTAD was supplied by Luminescence Technology Corp, Taiwan, China.\n\nOleate-capped and monodispersed \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+ nanoparticles were synthesized according to the literature []. Relevant solution of lanthanide complexes (1\u202fM) were prepared by dissolving the particular lanthanide hydrochloride in deionized water with an ultrasonic cleaning bath. In a typical procedure, 5\u202fmL of aqueous solution containing YCl3, YbCl3, ErCl3 and ScCl3 (lanthanide ion molar ratio, Y3+/Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+ = (78%\u2212x)/20%/2%/x, x\u202f=\u202f0%, 2%, 4%, 8% and 16%) mixed with 30\u202fmL of oleic acid (OA, AR, Aladdin) and 75\u202fmL of 1-octadecene (ODE, AR, Aladdin) were added into a 250\u202fmL three-necked \ufb02ask under stirring. The mixture was heated to 160\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin under an Ar atmosphere to form a bright yellow transparent solution, and then cooled down gradually to 50\u202f\u00b0C. Afterwards, 40\u202fmL of methanol (purity\u202f\u2265\u202f99.9%, Aladdin) solution containing 0.5\u202fg of NaOH (purity 98%, Aladdin) and 0.74\u202fg of NH4F (purity 99.99%, Aladdin) was added drop by drop in the \ufb02ask and keep the reaction at 50\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin. After that, the solution was heated at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin to remosve the methanol solvent. Then the system is heated up to 310\u202f\u00b0C at a heating rate of 15\u202f\u00b0C\u00b7min\u22121 and kept the temperature for 60\u202fmin in the flowing of the argon. Finally, the mixture was cooled down rapidly to room temperature and the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol/cyclohexane several times to remove possible remnants. Thus the core of \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+ nanoparticles was synthesized.\nFor the synthesis of NaYF4 shell, the steps are the same as those for \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+ core, except replacing 5\u202fmL of the mixture of lanthanide hydrochlorides by YCl3 aqueous solution alone and slowly dropping 25\u202fmL of cyclohexane solution of the obtained core particles (0.1\u202fmol\u202fL\u22121) into the reaction flask before NaOH and NH4F methanol solution was added.\nThe \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles were obtained by acid treatment [].

Afterwards the UCNPs were collected by centrifugation at 13000\u202frpm and washed with distilled water several times, and then re-dispersed in absolute ethanol.\n\n\u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+@NaYF4 UCNPs were mixed with the commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NRT, Dyesol) for preparing the mesoporous layer of PSCs. Brie\ufb02y, a concentration of 1\u202fmol\u202fL\u22121 UCNPs ethanol solution was prepared by dispersing 1\u202fmmol of \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Sc3+@NaYF4 UCNPs into 1\u202fmL of absolute ethanol. Then the solution was mixed with the commercial TiO2 paste corresponding different mass-fractions respect to TiO2 varying from Y\u202f=\u202f15%\u2013100%. The mixtures were diluted in different amount of absolute ethanol to keep the concentration of 0.1\u202fg\u202fmL\u22121, and then ultrasonicated and stirred overnight.

A compact TiO2 layer with thickness about 40\u202fnm was prepared by spin-coating 0.15\u202fM titanium diisopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate) (75\u202fwt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in a 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution onto the substrate at 2500\u202frpm for 30\u202fs, and then annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin. A scaffold layer about 150\u2013200\u202fnm with different UCNPs/TiO2 weight ratios was prepared by spin coating mixed paste at 2000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs and then annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin.\nCesium-containing triple cation perovskite (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 was synthesized by using one-step spin-coating procedure [,,]. Brie\ufb02y, a perovskite precursor solution containing 171.9\u202fmg of FAI, 507.1\u202fmg of PbI2, 21.32\u202fmg of MABr and 76.67\u202fmg of PbBr2 was prepared in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO totally 950\u202f\u03bcL with a volume ratio of 4:1. Then 50\u202f\u03bcL of CsI solution in DMSO (1.5\u202fM) was added into the mixed perovskite precursor solution to achieve the desired triple cation composition. The precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000\u202frpm for 10\u202fs and then at 6000\u202frpm for 20\u202fs. During the second step, 130\u202f\u03bcL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate 5\u202fs prior to the end of the program to rinse out residual DMSO and DMF in the precursor films. The substrate was then annealed at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin on a hotplate to form crystalline triple cation perovskite layers.\nAfterwards, the spiro-OMeTAD layers were subsequently deposited on top of the as-prepared triple cation perovskite layers by spin-coating 20\u202f\u03bcL of chlorobenzene solution contained 72.3\u202fmg of spiro-OMeTAD, 1\u202fmL of chlorobenzene, 28.8\u202f\u03bcL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5\u202f\u03bcL of bis (tri\ufb02uoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (520\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 in acetonitrile) at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs. Finally, about 100-nm-thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated on the spiro-OMeTAD layers under high vacuum through a shadow mask. Thus the PSCs with the active area of 0.1\u202fcm2 (0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4\u202fcm2) were prepared.\n\nThe crystal structures of samples were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Smart Lab, Rigaku) using graphite monochromatic copper radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.5418\u202f\u00c5). The morphologies characterizations were performed on the \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU8000, Hitachi) and a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The UC luminescence and was measured via the FLS 980E spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., UK), in which the excitation light source is a 980\u202fnm laser. The transmittance, reflection and absorption spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic curves of PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under 100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122 (AM 1.5\u202fG) illumination provided by a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A class, USA, calibrated by a Newport reference cell) with pre sweep delay of 0.04\u202fs, max reverse bias of 0.1\u202fV, max forward bias of 2.0\u202fV, dwell time of 30\u202fms in ambient environment. Average photovoltaic parameters of the each proposed PSC sample were obtained from 20 devices to check the reproducibility. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra was acquired using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Lumina, ThermoFisher) equipped with a Xenon lamp at an excitation wavelength of 507\u202fnm. The incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured as a function of wavelength from 300\u202fnm to 1100\u202fnm using the Newport incident photo-to-electron conversion ef\ufb01ciency (IPCE) system (Newport, USA). The NIR response of the PSC devices was tested using a 980\u202fnm laser with a power of 200\u202fmW (MDL-III-980L, CNI). The stabilized current density and power output were recorded close to the maximum power point, which was extracted from the J-V curves. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (IM6) under AM 1.5G with the frequencies from 100\u202fmHz to 1\u202fMHz, the bias of 0\u202fV and the amplitude of 20\u202fmV. Long-term stability under persistent moisture was tested by XRD measurement for 7 days and record of time-dependent photovoltaic performances for 400\u202fh under ambient condition with 40% RH and 25\u202f\u00b0C without encapsulation.

For the Zn-doped NiOx precursor solution, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (5%) was mixed with Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and dissolved in ethylene glycol solution containing ethylenediamine (Sigma Aldrich). The NiOx:Zn films exhibit morphology uniformity, high transparence, and enhanced conductivity compared with pure NiOx films, which can be referred to our previous work [].\n\nThe perovskite photovoltaic device had a planar structure of FTO/NiOx:Zn/MAPbI3/[,]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates were washed successively with deionized water, acetone. After that, the etched and cleaned FTO glass were dried in nitrogen \ufb02ow and treated by UV-ozone for 15\u202fmin for device fabrication. The zinc doped NiOx precursor solution was spin-coated onto FTO substrate at a speed of 5000\u202frpm for 40\u202fs and then post-annealed at 400\u202f\u00b0C in ambient air for 60\u202fmin [,]. To form a MAPbI3 perovskite precursor (1\u202fM), an equimolar ratio of PbI2 and MAI was dissolved in DMF with different amounts of Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The bladed coating of perovskite films was deposited in an N2-purged glovebox (below 0.1\u202fppm O2 and H2O). In the doctor-blade coating process, the perovskite precursor solution was dripped onto the FTO glass on a hot plate set at 150\u202f\u00b0C, then the glass blade swiped linearly at a speed about 1.5\u202fcm\u202fs\u22121. After blading, the substrates were quickly removed from the hot plate and annealed at 100\u202f\u00b0C in N2-purged glovebox for 10\u202fmin. We used 10\u202f\u03bcL of precursor solution per 2.25\u202fcm2 substrate. This was much less than 20\u201350\u202f\u03bcL typically used for spin coating of similar perovskite solutions over the same area substrate, which demonstrated the advantages of efficient material usage by doctor-blade coating. The PCBM layer was spin-coated at 3000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs from chlorobenzene with a concentration of 20\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121, and then the BCP (0.5\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 in IPA) layer was spin-coated at 4000\u202frpm for 30\u202fs on the PCBM film.

The photoluminescence (PL) signal dispersed by a monochrometer was detected by a photomultiplier (PMTH-S1-CR131) through a lock-in amplifier (SR 830). For time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra measurements, a 405\u202fnm nanosencond diode laser was used as excitation source. The optical absorption spectra were examined by a UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Nicolet iS50) was used to analyze the perovskite films. Raman spectra were measured by a Horiba spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution) using an Nd: YAG laser beam at the excitation wavelength of 532\u202fnm. Current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2612 source measure unit under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum (100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122)\u202fby a solar simulator (San-Ei, 3A, 150\u202fW) with different scanning directions. The J-V measurement was performed in the ambient air with a humidity of around 40%, and the device area is 0.14\u202fcm2, which is defined by the cross section of Ag and FTO. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a QEX10 system (PV Measurement).\n\nFemtosecond transient absorption was detected using a pump\u2013probe method to measure differential absorption (\u0394OD) spectra and their decay profile. Laser pulses (800\u202fnm, 50 fs pulse length, 1\u202fkHz repetition rate) were generated by a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser (Hurricane, Spectra-Physics) source. An optical parametric amplifier was used to change the laser wavelength. The pump pulses at 560\u202fnm were generated by a 1-mm-thick BBO crystal as a second harmonic of the laser. Pump power was carefully controlled by a neutral density filter (4\u202f\u03bcJ\u202fcm\u22122 per pulse in front of glass side) to minimize the effect of carrier annihilation or non-geminate recombination. For the white light continuum (WLC) probe pulses we used the super-continuum generation from a thin sapphire window (3\u202fmm in thickness). The time delay between pump and probe was carefully controlled in such a way that the pump beam travels along a variable optical delay. A chopper was used to block every other pump pulse, and each probe pulse was measured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) after dispersion by a grating spectrograph. The polarization angle between pump and probe beams was set to the magic angle (54.7\u00b0) by placing a Berek compensator in the pump beam. The kinetic of the different scans stay the same showing no sign of degradation. Excitation power and spot size measurements were used to determine the excitation fluence.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: NiO-c,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Zn,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: PAA,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Doctor blading,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 10,\n HTL_stack_sequence: PCBM-60 | BCP,\n HTL_additives_compounds: ,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.14,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: pin,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "FTO (NSG TECTM 8.8\u202f\u03a9/sq) coated glass was cut into pieces of 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm2 in size and partially etched with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid.

The cells were scanned from forward bias to short circuit and back at a rate of 0.15 V s\u22121 and 0.025 V s\u22121 after holding under illumination at 1.2 V for 2 s. To eliminate the contribution of the area surrounding each pixel, a mask that covers these areas from illumination was employed.\nFor transient photocurrent measurements, the light of an inorganic LED (Thorlabs TO-1 \u00be, \u03bb = 465 nm) was pulsed by a function generator (Agilent/Keysight 33510B; pulse length = 2 ms) and focused on the solar cell. The resulting photocurrent was measured with an oscilloscope (Picoscope 5443A) with a 50 \u03a9 terminator placed across the oscilloscope input.\n\nZnO samples for XPS/UPS measurements were prepared as described above on ITO substrates and then transferred to the ultrahigh vacuum chamber of the XPS system (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The XPS measurements were performed using a XR6 monochromated Al K\u03b1 source (h\u03bd = 1486.6 eV) and a pass energy of 20 eV. UPS measurements were carried out using a He discharge lamp (h\u03bd = 21.2 eV) and a pass energy of 2 eV. Measurements were collected at three different spots for each sample. XPS depth profiling was performed using an Ar cluster source with cluster energy of 4000 eV. AFM (Bruker MultiMode) was performed in tapping mode in air with silicon tips (Bruker NTESPA) to study the surface morphology of the undoped and doped ZnO films. Layers for PDS characterisation were prepared on spectrosil in an identical fashion to those for photovoltaic devices. In the N2 glovebox the samples were placed into a sample holder filled with Fluorinert FC-770 (IoLiTec). A 150 W Xenon short-arc lamp (Ushio) provides light for a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel, FWHM 16 nm) to achieve a chopped, tunable, monochromatic pump beam. The heat caused through absorption of the pump light in the films changes the refractive index of the Fluorinert. This change is detected by deflecting a probe He-Ne-laser (REO) whose displacement in turn is measured by a position-sensitive-detector (Thorlabs, PDP90A). The magnitude of the deflection is determined by a lock-in amplifier (Amatec SR 7230) and directly correlated to the absorption of the film.\n\nTo study the effect of doping and surface modification of ZnO on the perovskite film formation, scanning electron microscopy was conducted using an Ultra FE-SEM Gemini Ultra 55 (Zeiss) microscope with a working distance of 3 mm and an acceleration voltage of 1.6 kV. Samples were mounted on standard SEM holders using conductive silver paste to avoid sample charging. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out inside an integrating sphere (LabSphere) with excitation by a 447 nm diode laser (Dragon Lasers). The spectra were recorded using a QE65000 (Ocean Optics) spectrometer.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | ITO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: ZnO-c | PCBA,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating | Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 80,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 30,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Ag,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}, {"instruction": "Summarize stack and method information from given paragraph about solar cell.", "input": "PbI2, PbBr2 (99.9985%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and chlorobenzene (CB) were from Alfar Aesar.

An 80\u202fnm thick Au top electrode was deposited by using thermal evaporator at a high vacuum.\n\nUV\u2013vis absorption and PL spectra for all the films were measured using a Scinco UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (S-3100, Korea) and Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with 15\u202fW Xenon lamp, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were obtained using JSMJSM-6700F (JEOL) FESEM. One dimensional X-ray diffraction (1D-XRD) measurements were recorded using X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2500) with Cu-K\u03b1 X-rays. The different ETL layer thickness was determined by cross-sectional FESEM and alpha-step (D-300, Stylus) profilometer.\n\nThe electrical characteristics were measured with a solar simulator LAB50 (McScience) for a one-sun condition along with attached Keithley. The light was calibrated with a standard mono-Si solar cell (PVM-396, PV Measurements Inc.) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a photomodulation spectroscopy setup (McScience, K3100 Spectral IPCE Measurement System) with monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp. The power density of the monochromatic light source was calibrated using a Si photodiode certified by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. Light intensity (I) -dependent J-V characteristics were measured with the same solar simulator setup by varying the sun intensity from 10\u2013100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122.\n\n", "output": "<s> Substrate_stack_sequence: SLG | FTO,\n ETL_stack_sequence: TiO2-mp,\n ETL_additives_compounds: Unknown,\n ETL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_composition_long_form: MAPbI3,\n Perovskite_composition_short_form: MAPbI,\n Perovskite_additives_compounds: ,\n Perovskite_deposition_solvents: DMF; DMSO,\n Perovskite_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_temperature: 100,\n Perovskite_deposition_thermal_annealing_time: 15,\n HTL_stack_sequence: Spiro-MeOTAD,\n HTL_additives_compounds: FK209; Li-TFSI; TBP,\n HTL_deposition_procedure: Spin-coating,\n Backcontact_stack_sequence: Au,\n Backcontact_additives_compounds: ,\n Backcontact_deposition_procedure: Evaporation,\n Stability_measured: FALSE,\n Stability_average_over_n_number_of_cells: 1,\n Stability_temperature_range: nan; nan,\n Stability_atmosphere: Unknown,\n Stability_time_total_exposure: ,\n Stability_PCE_initial_value: ,\n Stability_PCE_end_of_experiment: ,\n Cell_area_measured: 0.1,\n Cell_number_of_cells_per_substrate: 0,\n Cell_architecture: nip,\n Cell_flexible: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent: FALSE,\n Cell_semitransparent_wavelength_range: nan; nan,\n Module: FALSE</s>"}]
